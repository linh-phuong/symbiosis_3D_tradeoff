	abstract = {Obligate symbiosis evolved from free-living individuals most likely via the intermediate stage of facultative symbiosis. However, why should facultative symbionts, who can live independently but also benefit from their partners if these are available, give up this best of both worlds? Using the adaptive dynamics approach, we analyse a simple model, focusing on one partner of the symbiosis, to gain more insight into the selective forces that make individuals forgo the ability to reproduce in the free-living state. Our results suggest that, similar to the parasitism-mutualism continuum, the free-living way of life and obligate symbiosis are two extremes of a continuum of the ability to reproduce independently of a partner. More importantly, facultative symbiosis should be the rule as for many parameter combinations completely giving up independent reproduction or adopting a pure free-living strategy is not so easy. We also show that if host encounter comes at a cost, individuals that put more effort into increasing the chances to meet with their partners are more likely to give up the ability to reproduce independently. Finally, our model does not specify the ecological interactions between hosts and symbionts but we discuss briefly how the ecological nature of an interaction can influence the transition from facultative to obligate symbiosis.},

	abstract = {When a more complex, functionally integrated entity emerges from the association of simpler, initially independent entities, a major evolutionary transition has occurred. Transitions that result from the association of different species include the evolution of the eukaryotic cell and some obligate mutualisms. Recent studies are revolutionizing our understanding of how these intimate interspecific associations come to be, revealing how and to what extent each partner contributes to the relationship, and how partners mediate conflict. Here, we review work on the evolution of mutualistic symbioses in the context of transitions in individuality and highlight how a better mechanistic understanding of the ecological drivers of host-symbiont interdependencies can help elucidate the evolutionary path to symbiotic organismality.},

	abstract = {Eusociality, in which some individuals reduce their own lifetime reproductive potential to raise the offspring of others, underlies the most advanced forms of social organization and the ecologically dominant role of social insects and humans. For the past four decades kin selection theory, based on the concept of inclusive fitness, has been the major theoretical attempt to explain the evolution of eusociality. Here we show the limitations of this approach. We argue that standard natural selection theory in the context of precise models of population structure represents a simpler and superior approach, allows the evaluation of multiple competing hypotheses, and provides an exact framework for interpreting empirical observations.},

@article{tarnita:JTB:2013,
	abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of life on earth is one of increasing size and complexity. Yet the standard equations of evolutionary dynamics describe mutation and selection among similar organisms that compete on the same level of organization. Here we begin to outline a mathematical theory that might help to explore how evolution can be constructive, how natural selection can lead from lower to higher levels of organization. We distinguish two fundamental operations, which we call 'staying together' and 'coming together'. Staying together means that individuals form larger units by not separating after reproduction, while coming together means that independent individuals form aggregates. Staying together can lead to specialization and division of labor, but the developmental program must evolve in the basic unit. Coming together can be creative by combining units with different properties. Both operations have been identified in the context of multicellularity, but they have been treated very similarly. Here we point out that staying together and coming together can be found at every level of biological construction and moreover that they face different evolutionary problems. The distinction is particularly clear in the context of cooperation and defection. For staying together the stability of cooperation takes the form of a developmental error threshold, while coming together leads to evolutionary games and requires a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. We use our models to discuss simple aspects of the evolution of protocells, eukarya, multi-cellularity and animal societies.},

@article{queller:PTRSB:2000,
	abstract = {Many of the major transitions in evolution involved the coalescence of independent lower--level units into a higher organismal level. This paper examines the role of kinship, focusing on the transitions to multicellularity in animals and to coloniality in insects. In both, kin selection based on high relatedness permitted cooperation and a reproductive division of labour. The higher relatedness of haplodiploid females to their sisters than to their offspring might not have been crucial in the origin of insect societies, and the transition to multicellularity shows that such special relationships are not required. When multicellular forms develop from a single cell, selfish conflict is minimal because each selfish mutant obtains only one generation of within--individual advantage in a chimaera. Conditionally expressed traits are particularly immune to within--individual selfishness because such mutations are rarely expressed in chimaeras. Such conditionally expressed altruism genes lead easily to the evolution of the soma, and the germ line might simply be what is left over. In most social insects, differences in relatedness ensure that there will be potential conflicts. Power asymmetries sometimes lead to such decisive settlements of conflicts that social insect colonies can be considered to be fully organismal.},

@article{Hinsinger2005,
	abstract = {The rhizosphere differs from the bulk soil in a range of biochemical, chemical and physical processes that occur as a consequence of root growth, water and nutrient uptake, respiration and rhizodeposition. These processes also affect microbial ecology and plant physiology to a considerable extent. This review concentrates on two features of this unique environment: rhizosphere geometry and heterogeneity in both space and time. Although it is often depicted as a soil cylinder of a given radius around the root, drawing a boundary between the rhizosphere and bulk soil is an impossible task because rhizosphere processes result in gradients of different sizes. For instance, because of diffusional constraints, root uptake can result in a depletion zone extending {\textless}1 mm for phosphate to several centimetres for nitrate, while respiration may affect the bulk of the soil. Rhizosphere processes are responsible for spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the soil, although these are sometimes difficult to distinguish from intrinsic soil heterogeneity. A further complexity is that these processes are regulated by plants, microbial communities and soil constituents, and their many interactions. Novel in situ techniques and modelling will help in providing a holistic view of rhizosphere functioning, which is a prerequisite for its management and manipulation.},

@article{Cator2012,
	abstract = {Malaria parasites have been suggested to alter the behavior of mosquito vectors to increase the likelihood of transmission. Some empirical evidence supports this hypothesis, yet the role of manipulation is ignored in most epidemiological models, and behavioral differences between infected and uninfected females are not considered in the development or implementation of control measures. We suggest that this disconnect exists because the link between behavioral alteration and actual transmission in the field has yet to be demonstrated or quantified fully. We review and discuss the current evidence for manipulation, explore its potential significance for malaria transmission, and suggest ways to move this hypothesis forward from theory to potential application in malaria control. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Cavalier-Smith2013,
	abstract = {Symbiogenesis is the extremely rare, but permanent merger of two organ- isms from phylogenetically distant lineages into one radically more complex organism. Three examples are exceptionally important: intracellular enslavement by an early eukaryote of an $\alpha$-proteobacterium by host protein insertion to make mitochondria; later conversion of a cyanobacterium into the first chloroplast, thereby forming kingdom Plantae; and secondary enslavement of a red alga to yield more complex membrane topology in the phagophototrophic kingdom Chromista. Two other cases involved indepen- dent acquisition of green-algal chloroplasts by ancestrally phagotrophic lin- eages, yielding chlorarachnean algae (phylum Cercozoa, within the chromist infrakingdom Rhizaria) and euglenophyte algae (phylum Euglenozoa, within the protozoan subkingdom Eozoa). Less radically, chloroplast replacement occurred within dinoflagellate Chromista by two symbiogeneses: Green- algal or haptophyte chloroplasts replaced ancestral peridinin-containing chloroplasts. These seven lineage mergers were all mediated by the evo- lution of novel modes of transmembrane protein import into the enslaved cell, allowing massive gene transfer from symbionts to host genomes.},

Bacteriophage f1 was used as the parasite because it establishes a debilitating but non-fatal infection that can be transmitted vertically (from a host to its progeny) as well as horizontally (infection of new hosts). Horizontal transmission was required of all phage at specific intervals, but was prevented otherwise. Each episode of horizontal transmission was followed by an interval of obligate vertical transmission, followed by an interval of obligate horizontal transmission etc. The duration of vertical transmission was eight times longer per episode in one treatment than in the other, thus varying the relative intensity of selection against virulence while maintaining selection for some level of virus production. Viral lines with the higher enforced rate of infectious transmission evolved higher virulence and higher rates of virus production. These results support the trade-off model for the evolution of virulence.},

	abstract = {The identification of accessory genetic elements (plasmids, phages and chromosomal 'pathogenicity islands') encoding virulence-associated genes has facilitated our efforts to understand the origination of pathogenic microorganisms. Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, represents a paradigm for this process in that this organism evolved from environmental nonpathogenic V. cholerae by acquisition of virulence genes. The major virulence genes in V. cholerae, which are clustered in several chromosomal regions, appear to have been recently acquired from phages or through undefined horizontal gene transfer events. Evidence is accumulating that the interactions of phages with each other can also influence the emergence of pathogenic clones of V. cholerae. Therefore, to track the evolution of pathogens from their nonpathogenic progenitors, it is also crucial to identify and characterize secondary genetic elements that mediate lateral transfer of virulence genes in trans. Understanding the evolutionary events that lead to the emergence of pathogenic clones might provide new approaches to the control of cholera and other infectious diseases.},

Yet cooperation is common be- tween members of the same species and even between members of different spe- cies.

This position followed from a misreading of theory that as- signed most adaptation to selection at the level of populations or whole spe- cies. As a result of such misreading, cooperation was always considered adaptive. Recent reviews of the evolu- tionary process, however, have shown no sound basis for a pervasive group- benefit view of selection; at the level of a species or a population, the processes of selection are weak. The original individ- ualistic emphasis of Darwin's theory is more valid.},

@article{Keeling2017a,
	abstract = {Endosymbiosis is an idea that provided a remarkable amount of explanatory power about the origins of eukaryotic organelles. But it also promoted a number of assumptions that have also been influential, but are less well-examined. Here we look at two of these to see whether or not they fit current evidence. The assumption we first address is that endosymbiotic relationships such as nutritional symbioses and eukaryotic organelles are mutualisms. We argue instead that they are more one-sided associations that can be regarded as context-dependent power struggles like any other ecological interaction. The second assumption is that during endosymbiotic interactions (such as the origin of organelles), the host genomes will acquire a great many genes from endosymbionts that assume functions in host systems (as opposed to the well-documented genes whose products are simply targeted back to the endosymbiont or organelle). The idea that these genes exist in large numbers has been influential in a number of hypotheses about organelle evolution and distribution, but in the most carefully-examined systems no such mass migration of genes is evident. Overall, we argue that both the nature and impact of endosymbiosis need to be constantly re-evaluated to fully understand what roles it really plays in both cell biology and evolution.},

Theoretical models addressing the evolution of virulence have considered two within host infection outcomes, namely superinfection and coinfection. The field somehow became limited by this dichotomy that does not correspond to an empirical reality as other infection patterns, namely sets of within-host infection outcomes, are possible. We indeed formally prove there are over one hundred different infection patterns solely for recoverable chronic infections caused by two genetically distinct horizontally-transmitted microparasites. We afterwards highlight eight infection patterns using an explicit modelling of within-host dynamics that captures a large range of ecological interactions, five of which have been neglected so far. To clarify the terminology related to multiple infections, we introduce terms describing these new relevant patterns and illustrate them with existing biological systems. These infection patterns constitute a new framework for linking within-host and between-host dynamics, which is a requirement to forward our understanding of the epidemiology and the evolution of parasites.},

Can genetic correlations influence whether evolution converges to a stable trait vector? Mathematical methods: Adaptive dynamics theory and the weak selection limit of quantitative genetics. Key assumptions: Evolutionary change is represented as either (i) any gradualistic adaptive path in trait space, consisting of a sequence of small-effect mutant invasions, allowing for pleiotropic mutants, or (ii) a solution to the `canonical equation' of adaptive dynamics with a gradually varying mutational covariance matrix. Assumption (ii) is a special case of (i). Conclusions: It is possible to formulate robust stability conditions for multidimensional traits, but most evolutionary equilibria will not satisfy these conditions. Under the liberal assumption (i), there will in general be no `absolutely convergence stable' equilibria in multidimensional trait spaces (except for simplified models). Under the more restrictive assumption (ii), a much larger proportion of evolutionary equilibria is `strongly convergence stable', i.e. are stable irrespective of genetic correlations. Keywords:},

	abstract = {A dominant theme in the history of life has been the evolutionary innovations of cooperative symbioses: the first genomes near the origin of life, integrated prokaryotic cells, the complex symbiotic communities that evolved into modern eukaryotic cells, lichens, mycorrhizae, and so on. In this paper, a model of cooperative symbiosis that shows a threshold condition for the evolution of cooperation is analyzed. The threshold is not easily passed, but cooperative evolution proceeds rapidly once a symbiosis overcomes the threshold. In the model presented here, each species has genetic variability for a symbiotic trait. The trait imposes a reproductive cost on its bearer but enhances the reproduction of its partner species. For example, in the origin of genetic systems, the trait may cause biochemical synergism for the rate of replication of primitive RNA strands as in Eigen and Schuster's hypercycle model. Models of growth are contrasted with synergism, which are most appropriate for the evolution of genetic systems and for mutualisms such as lichens, with the strategic and psychological applications of the Prisoner's Dilemma model.},

@article{Wolf2013,
	abstract = {A common belief is that evolution generally proceeds towards greater complexity at both the organismal and the genomic level, numerous examples of reductive evolution of parasites and symbionts notwithstanding. However, recent evolutionary reconstructions challenge this notion. Two notable examples are the reconstruction of the complex archaeal ancestor and the intron-rich ancestor of eukaryotes. In both cases, evolution in most of the lineages was apparently dominated by extensive loss of genes and introns, respectively. These and many other cases of reductive evolution are consistent with a general model composed of two distinct evolutionary phases: the short, explosive, innovation phase that leads to an abrupt increase in genome complexity, followed by a much longer reductive phase, which encompasses either a neutral ratchet of genetic material loss or adaptive genome streamlining. Quantitatively, the evolution of genomes appears to be dominated by reduction and simplification, punctuated by episodes of complexification.},

	abstract = {From hundreds of independent transitions from a free-living existence to a parasitic mode of life, separate parasite lineages have converged over evolutionary time to share traits and exploit their hosts in similar ways. Here, we first summarize the evidence that, at a phenotypic level, eukaryotic parasite lineages have all converged toward only six general parasitic strategies: parasitoid, parasitic castrator, directly transmitted parasite, trophically transmitted parasite, vector-transmitted parasite or micropredator. We argue that these strategies represent adaptive peaks, with the similarities among unrelated taxa within any strategy extending to all basic aspects of host exploitation and transmission among hosts and transcending phylogenetic boundaries. Then, we extend our examination of convergent patterns by looking at the evolution of parasite genomes. Despite the limited taxonomic coverage of sequenced parasite genomes currently available, we find some evidence of parallel evolution among unrelated parasite taxa with respect to genome reduction or compaction, and gene losses or gains. Matching such changes in parasite genomes with the broad phenotypic traits that define the convergence of parasites toward only six strategies of host exploitation is not possible at present. Nevertheless, as more parasite genomes become available, we may be able to detect clear trends in the evolution of parasitic genome architectures representing true convergent adaptive peaks, the genomic equivalents of the phenotypic strategies used by all parasites.},

@article{Barton2005,
	abstract = {In finite populations subject to selection, genetic drift generates negative linkage disequilibrium, on average, even if selection acts independently (i.e., multiplicatively) upon all loci. Negative disequilibrium reduces the variance in fitness and hence, by Fisher's (1930) fundamental theorem, slows the rate of increase in mean fitness. Modifiers that increase recombination eliminate the negative disequilibria that impede selection and consequently increase in frequency by "hitchhiking." Thus, stochastic fluctuations in linkage disequilibrium in finite populations favor the evolution of increased rates of recombination, even in the absence of epistatic interactions among loci and even when disequilibrium is initially absent. The method developed within this article allows us to quantify the strength of selection acting on a modifier allele that increases recombination in a finite population. The analysis indicates that stochastically generated linkage disequilibria do select for increased recombination, a result that is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Selection for a modifier that increases recombination is highest when linkage among loci is tight, when beneficial alleles rise from low to high frequency, and when the population size is small.},

Species of primary interest were the main malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An.arabiensis, sibling species belonging to the An.gambiae complex. Data for An.funestus, An.pharoensis, Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia uniformis were also analysed. Carbon dioxide was used at concentrations of 0.04-0.6{\%} (cf. 0.03{\%} ambient concentration) for attracting mosquitoes to odour-baited entry traps (OBETs). The "attractiveness' of whole human odour was also compared with CO2 emitted at a rate equivalent to that released by the human bait. In a direct choice test with two OBETs placed side-by-side, the number of An.gambiae s.l. entering the trap with human odour was double the number trapped with CO2 alone (at the human equivalent rate), but there was no significant difference between OBETs for the other species of mosquitoes. When OBETs were positioned 20 m apart, again CO2 alone attracted half as many An.gambiae s.l. and only 40{\%} An.funestus, 65{\%} Ma.uniformis but twice as many An.pharoensis compared to the number trapped with human odour. The dose-response for all mosquito species was essentially similar: a linear increase in catch with increasing dose on a log-log scale. The slopes of the dose-response curves were not significantly different between species, although there were significant differences in the relative numbers caught. If the dose-response data are considered in relation to a standard human bait collection (HBC), however, the behaviour of each species was quite different. At one extreme, even the highest dose of CO2 did not catch more An.gambiae s.l. than one HBC. At the other extreme, the three highest doses of CO2 caught significantly more Ma.uniformis than did one HBC. An.pharoensis and Cx quinquefasciatus showed a threshold response to CO2, responding only at doses above that normally released by one man. An.funestus did not respond to CO2 alone at any dose in sufficient numbers to assess the dose response. Within the An.gambiae complex, An.arabiensis "chose' the CO2-baited trap with a higher probability than An.gambiae s.s. Also An.arabiensis, the less anthropophilic of the two species, was more abundant in CO2-baited OBETs than in human bait collections.},

We find that host cooperation is more likely to be maintained towards the MA end of the continuum, as the more frequent bottlenecks associated with an MA-like interaction can prevent defector invasion, and can even allow migrant cooperators to invade populations of defectors.},

To date, 8 complete bacterial genomes have been sequenced, and at least 40 more will be completed in the near future. Such projects give wonderfully detailed information concerning the structure of the organism's genes and the overall organization of the sequenced genomes. It will be very important to put this incredible wealth of detail into a larger biological picture: How does this information apply to the genomes of related genera, related species, or even other individuals from the same species? Recent advances in pulsed-field gel electrophoretic technology have facilitated the construction of complete and accurate physical maps of bacterial chromosomes, and the many maps constructed in the past decade have revealed unexpected and substantial differences in genome size and organization even among closely related bacteria. This review focuses on this recently appreciated plasticity in structure of bacterial genomes, and diversity in genome size, replicon geometry, and chromosome number are discussed at inter- and intraspecies levels.},

We demonstrate two mechanisms by which increased soil fertility may cause interactions to change from mutualistic to parasitic: as relative benefits to the plant decrease with increasing soil fertility, the interaction between the fungus and its host turns parasitic; with two fungal species - one a mutualist and the other a cheater - increasing soil fertility can favor the cheater if mutualists have faster growth rates than cheaters. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A correlation between the presence of intestinal protozoa in termites and a wood-feeding habit was postulated by Imms,2 and this, if true, as Imms pointed out, indicates a possible symbiotic relationship between termites and their intestinal protozoa. After making several microchemical tests on the protozoa, Buscalioni and Comes3 concluded that the protozoa digest the wood particles which they take into their bodies; and from this conclusion , without stopping to consider whether or not the protozoa can digest wood, these authors claim that they have established symbiosis between termites and their intestinal protozoa. Other investigators, notably Grassi4 5 and Kofoid,6 though devoting most of their time to sys-tematics and morphology, have usually regarded the protozoa either as commensals or parasites.

Horizontally transmitted symbionts are taken up from the environment anew by each host generation, and vertically transmitted symbionts are most often transferred through the female germ line. Mixed modes also exist. In this Review we describe the journey of symbionts from the initial contact to their final residence. We provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms that mediate symbiont attraction and accumulation, interpartner recognition and selection, as well as symbiont confrontation with the host immune system. We also discuss how the two main transmission modes shape the evolution of the symbiotic partners. Symbiont transmission maintains symbioses through host generations and has a pivotal role in their evolution 1 -5 . Despite growing evidence that microbial associations are present in diverse animals and plants in virtually every environment, our knowledge of the mechanisms of symbiont transmission is restricted to a few model systems. Most of these involve bacteria and some archaea 6 , 7 (Supplementary information S1 (table)). Two fundamentally different modes of transmission can be distinguished: horizontal (that is, from an environmental, free-living symbiont source) and vertical (that is, inheritance of the symbiont from the mother or, more rarely, from both parents). However, there is great variation, and transmission can also be mixed, involving both vertical and horizontal transfers from the environment and intraspecific or interspecific host switching (FIG. 1).},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. A mathematical model is presented that explores the relationship between transmission patterns and the evolution of virulence for horizontally transmitted parasites when only a single parasite strain can infect each host. The model is constructed by decomposing parasite transmission into two processes, the rate of contact between hosts and the probability of transmission per contact. These transmission rate components, as well as the total parasite mortality rate, are allowed to vary over the course of an infection. A general evolutionarily stable condition is presented that partitions the effects of virulence on parasite fitness into three components: fecundity benefits, mortality costs, and morbidity costs. This extension of previous theory allows us to explore the evolutionary consequences of a variety of transmission patterns. I then focus attention on a special case in which the parasite density remains approximately constant during an infection, and I demonstrate two important ways in which transmission modes can affect virulence evolution: by imposing different morbidity costs on the parasite and by altering the scheduling of parasite reproduction during an infection. Both are illustrated with examples, including one that examines the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites should be more virulent than non-vector-borne parasites (Ewald 1994). The validity of this hypothesis depends upon the way in which these two effects interact, and it need not hold in general.},

	abstract = {Most eukaryotes harbor a diverse community of parasitic, mutualistic, and commensal microbial symbionts. Although the diversity of these microbial symbiotic communities has recently drawn considerable attention, theory regarding the evolution of interactions among symbionts and with the host is still in its nascent stages. Here we evaluate the role of interactions among coinfecting symbionts in the evolution of symbiont virulence toward the host. To do so, we place the virulence-transmission trade-off into a community context and model the evolution of symbiont trophic modes along the continuum from parasitism (virulence) to mutualism (negative virulence). We establish a framework for studying multiple infections of a host by the same symbiont species and coinfection by multiple species, using a concept of shared costs, wherein the negative consequences of virulence (or harm) toward the host are shared among symbionts. Our results show that mutualism can be maintained under infection by multiple symbionts when shared costs are sufficiently low, while greater virulence and parasitism toward the host are more likely when shared costs are high. Last, for coinfection by more than one species, we show that if the presence of a mutualist ameliorates some of the costs of pathogen virulence, then the symbiotic community may more often evolve to a more commensal state and maintain mutualisms.},

	abstract = {Many taxa of parasites modify the behavior of their hosts in ways that improve their probability of transmission. Regardless of its evolutionary origins or underlying mechanisms, host manipulation is a widespread adaptive strategy yielding fitness benefits for parasites with various life cycles and transmission modes. This chapter focuses on recent developments that are expanding our understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, growing attention is being paid to the effect of parasites on whole suites of host behavioral traits as opposed to single traits, and to correlations among behaviors, which may be the target of manipulation instead of the traits themselves. At the same time, variation in the use of manipulation is being explored both among and within parasite species. On the one hand, models that take into account the potential costs of manipulation predict under what circumstances manipulation is likely to evolve as a transmission strategy. On the other hand, within manipulative species, manipulation may be a flexible strategy only adopted by individual parasites in certain conditions dictated by other parasites and by the host itself. This inter- and intraspecific variation in the use of host manipulation for transmission is due in large part to its unreliable effectiveness within complex natural systems where dead-ends await many manipulative parasites. Finally, recent neurological and proteomic studies of the pathways used by parasites to alter host behavior offer new insights into the evolution of manipulation. The chapter ends with a list of promising directions that provide an agenda for future research.},

@article{Mukabana2002,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have suggested that variability in the attractiveness of humans to host-seeking mosquitoes is caused by differences in the make-up of body emanations, and olfactory signals in particular. Most investigations have either been laboratory-based, utilising odour obtained from sections of the body, or have been done in the field with sampling methods that do not discriminate between visual, physical and chemical cues of the host. Accordingly, evidence for differential attractiveness based on body emanations remains sparse in spite of the far-reaching epidemiological implications of this phenomenon. METHODS: A new three-port olfactometer that accommodates complete human beings as sources of host-seeking stimuli was used to study behavioural responses of Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto (hereafter An. gambiae) under semi-field conditions in western Kenya. Differential attractiveness of nine male Kenyans was assessed by simultaneously exposing the mosquitoes to (a mixture of) total body emanations of 3 people occupying separate tents. Controls (empty tents) were included and the effect of residual odours following tent occupation was also examined. RESULTS: Trap catches increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) when a tent was occupied. Based on 'competition' experiments, the nine persons were classified into least, medium and most attractive groups. There was no significant interaction between person and trap (P = 0.302) or person and test period (P = 0.223). Presence (P {\textless} 0.001) or absence (P = 0.949) of significant differences in the number of mosquitoes caught per trap when tents were simultaneously occupied by one person in each or left empty, respectively, demonstrated that residual odours following tent occupation did not affect behavioural responses of the mosquitoes. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that in the vicinity of humans, when exposed to a blend of physical and olfactory signals from more than one host, An. gambiae can effectively and consistently express host-selection behaviour that results in non-random biting.},

	abstract = {The theoretical investigation of how spatial structure affects the evolution of social behavior has mostly been done under the assumption that parent-offspring strategy transmission is perfect, i.e., for genetically transmitted traits, that mutation is very weak or absent. Here, we investigate the evolution of social behavior in structured populations under arbitrary mutation probabilities. We consider populations of fixed size N, structured such that in the absence of selection, all individuals have the same probability of reproducing or dying (neutral reproductive values are the all same). Two types of individuals, A and B, corresponding to two types of social behavior, are competing; the fidelity of strategy transmission from parent to offspring is tuned by a parameter $\mu$. Social interactions have a direct effect on individual fecundities. Under the assumption of small phenotypic differences (implying weak selection), we provide a formula for the expected frequency of type A individuals in the population, and deduce conditions for the long-term success of one strategy against another. We then illustrate our results with three common life-cycles (Wright-Fisher, Moran Birth-Death and Moran Death-Birth), and specific population structures (graph-structured populations). Qualitatively, we find that some life-cycles (Moran Birth-Death, Wright-Fisher) prevent the evolution of altruistic behavior, confirming previous results obtained with perfect strategy transmission. We also show that computing the expected frequency of altruists on a regular graph may require knowing more than just the graph's size and degree.},

Plant parasitism has arisen time and again in multiple phyla, including bacteria, fungi, insects and nematodes. In most of these organismal groups, the overwhelming diversity hampers a robust reconstruction of the origins and diversification patterns of this trophic lifestyle. Being a moderately diversified phylum with ≈ 4,100 plant parasites (15{\%} of total biodiversity) subdivided over four independent lineages, nematodes constitute a major organismal group for which the genesis of plant parasitism could be mapped. Since substantial crop losses worldwide have been attributed to less than 1{\%} of these plant parasites, research efforts are severely biased towards this minority. With the first molecular characterisation of numerous basal and supposedly harmless plant parasites as well as their non-parasitic relatives, we were able to generate a comprehensive molecular framework that allows for the reconstruction of trophic diversification for a complete phylum. In each lineage plant parasites reside in a single taxonomic grouping (family or order), and by taking the coverage of the next lower taxonomic level as a measure for representation, 50, 67, 100 and 85{\%} of the known diversity was included. We revealed distinct gain and loss patterns with regard to plant parasitism per se as well as host exploitation strategies between these lineages. Our map of parasitic nematode biodiversity also revealed an unanticipated time reversal in which the two most ancient lineages showed the lowest level of ecological diversification and vice versa.},

	abstract = {A theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells ("higher" cells which divide by classical mitosis) is presented. By hypothesis, three fundamental organelles: the mitochondria, the photosynthetic plastids and the (9+2) basal bodies of flagella were themselves once free-living (prokaryotic) cells. The evolution of photosynthesis under the anaerobic conditions of the early atmosphere to form anaerobic bacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and eventually blue-green algae (and protoplastids) is described. The subsequent evolution of aerobic metabolism in prokaryotes to form aerobic bacteria (protoflagella and protomitochondria) presumably occurred during the transition to the oxidizing atmosphere. Classical mitosis evolved in protozoan-type cells millions of years after the evolution of photosynthesis. A plausible scheme for the origin of classical mitosis in primitive amoeboflagellates is presented. During the course of the evolution of mitosis, photosynthetic plastids (themselves derived from prokaryotes) were symbiotically acquired by some of these protozoans to form the eukaryotic algae and the green plants. The cytological, biochemical and paleontological evidence for this theory is presented, along with suggestions for further possible experimental verification. The implications of this scheme for the systematics of the lower organisms is discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Duplication, followed by fixation or random loss of novel genes, contributes to genome evolution. Particular outcomes of duplication events are possibly associated with pathogenic life histories in fungi. To date, differential gene gain and loss have not been studied at genomic scales in fungal pathogens, despite this phenomenon's known importance in virulence in bacteria and viruses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To determine if patterns of gene duplication differed between pathogens and non-pathogens, we identified gene families across nine euascomycete and two basidiomycete species. Gene family size distributions were fit to power laws to compare gene duplication trends in pathogens versus non-pathogens. Fungal phytopathogens showed globally altered patterns of gene duplication, as indicated by differences in gene family size distribution. We also identified sixteen examples of gene family expansion and five instances of gene family contraction in pathogenic lineages. Expanded gene families included those predicted to be important in melanin biosynthesis, host cell wall degradation and transport functions. Contracted families included those encoding genes involved in toxin production, genes with oxidoreductase activity, as well as subunits of the vacuolar ATPase complex. Surveys of the functional distribution of gene duplicates indicated that pathogens show enrichment for gene duplicates associated with receptor and hydrolase activities, while euascomycete pathogens appeared to have not only these differences, but also significantly more duplicates associated with regulatory and carbohydrate binding functions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Differences in the overall levels of gene duplication in phytopathogenic species versus non-pathogenic relatives implicate gene inventory flux as an important virulence-associated process in fungi. We hypothesize that the observed patterns of gene duplicate enrichment, gene family expansion and contraction reflect adaptation within pathogenic life histories. These adaptations were likely shaped by ancient, as well as contemporary, intimate associations with monocot hosts.},

	abstract = {Genetic factors are known to have a role in determining susceptibility to infectious diseases, although it is unclear whether they may also influence host efficiency in transmitting pathogens. We examine variants in HBB that have been shown to be protective against malaria and test whether these are associated with the transmission of the parasite from the human host to the Anopheles vector. We conducted cross-sectional malariological surveys on 3,739 human subjects and transmission experiments involving 60 children and 6,446 mosquitoes in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Protective hemoglobins C (HbC, beta6Glu--{\textgreater}Lys) and S (beta6Glu--{\textgreater}Val) are associated with a twofold in vivo (odds ratio 2.17, 95{\%} CI 1.57-3.01, P = 1.0 x 10(-6)) and a fourfold ex vivo (odds ratio 4.12, 95{\%} CI 1.90-9.29, P = 7.0 x 10(-5)) increase of parasite transmission from the human host to the Anopheles vector.

	abstract = {Research on life history strategies of microbial symbionts is key to understanding the evolution of cooperation with hosts, but also their survival between hosts. Rhizobia are soil bacteria known for fixing nitrogen inside legume root nodules. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous root symbionts that provide plants with nutrients and other benefits. Both kinds of symbionts employ strategies to reproduce during symbiosis using host resources; to repopulate the soil; to survive in the soil between hosts; and to find and infect new hosts. Here we focus on the fitness of the microbial symbionts and how interactions at each of these stages has shaped microbial life-history strategies. During symbiosis, microbial fitness could be increased by diverting more resources to individual reproduction, but that may trigger fitness-reducing host sanctions. To survive in the soil, symbionts employ sophisticated strategies, such as persister formation for rhizobia and reversal of spore germination by mycorrhizae. Interactions among symbionts, from rhizobial quorum sensing to fusion of genetically distinct fungal hyphae, increase adaptive plasticity. The evolutionary implications of these interactions and of microbial strategies to repopulate and survive in the soil are largely unexplored. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Trophically transmitted parasites often alter their intermediate host's phenotype, thereby predisposing the hosts to increased predation. This is generally considered a parasite strategy evolved to enhance transmission to the next hosts. However, the adaptive value of host manipulation is not clear as it may be associated with costs, such as increased susceptibility to predators that are unsuitable next hosts for the parasites. We examined the ratio between the benefits and costs of host manipulation for transmission success of Acanthocephalus lucii (Acanthocephala), a parasite that alters the hiding behaviour and pigmentation of its isopod hosts. We experimentally compared the susceptibility of infected and uninfected isopods to predation by perch (Perca fluvialis; definitive host of the parasite) and dragonfly larvae (dead end). We found that the parasite predisposed the isopods to predation by both predators. However, the increased predation vulnerability of the infected isopods was higher towards perch. This suggests that, despite the costs due to non-host predation, host manipulation may still be advantageous for the parasite.},

Although these strains were all collected from a Massachusetts (USA) estuary in 2007, phylogenetic reconstructions allowed us to reject the hypothesis that these newly described non-bioluminescent strains exhibit monophyly within the V. fischeri clade. These dark strains exhibited a competitive disadvantage against native bioluminescent strains when colonizing the light organ of the model V. fischeri host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes.

Mosquitoes can be marked to determine population size, distribution and flight distance or distinguish closely related species. In this study, two methods of colour marking mosquitoes were described in detail and the impact of both methods on the survival and host-seeking behaviour of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto was investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Mosquitoes were marked in groups with fluorescent powder or fluorescent dye. The powder was applied by creating a cloud of powder in a paper cup and the dye was applied with an airbrush. The effect of marking on the survival of mosquitoes of different age groups was tested under controlled conditions. The effect of marking on the host seeking response of the mosquitoes was tested in an olfactometer with human and cow odour as baits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No effect of either of the marking methods was found on the survival of mosquitoes that were treated 1 or 3 days after emergence, however, the survival of mosquitoes treated 5 or 9 days after emergence was significantly reduced. The host-seeking response of mosquitoes to human or cow odour was tested in a dual-port olfactometer and was not found to be affected by treatment with fluorescent powder or dye.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Both methods are suitable for colour marking large groups of mosquitoes. Marking with fluorescent powder, however, is preferred because the method is simpler, visible without a UV light and no specific materials are required.},

@article{Lefevre2009b,
	abstract = {Parasite-induced alteration of host behaviour is a widespread transmission strategy among pathogens. Understanding how it works is an exciting challenge from both a mechanistic and an evolutionary perspective. In this review, we use key examples to examine the proximate mechanisms by which parasites are known to control the behaviour of their hosts. Special attention is given to the recent developments of post-genomic tools, such as proteomics, for determining the genetic basis of parasitic manipulation. We then discuss two novel perspectives on host manipulation (mafia-like strategy and exploitation of host compensatory responses), arguing that parasite-manipulated behaviours could be the result of compromises between host and parasite strategies. Such compromises may occur when collaborating with the parasite is less costly for the host in terms of fitness than is resisting parasite-induced changes. Therefore, even when changes in host behaviour benefit the parasite, the host may still play some role in the switch in host behaviour. In other words, the host does not always become part of the parasite's extended phenotype. For example, parasites that alter host behaviour appear to induce widely disseminated changes in the hosts' central nervous system, as opposed to targeted attacks on specific neural circuits. In some host-parasite systems, the change in host behaviour appears to require the active participation of the host (e.g., via host immune-neural connections). Even when the change in host behaviour results in clear fitness benefits for the parasite, these behavioural changes may sometimes be produced by the host. Changes in host behaviour that decrease the fitness costs of infection could be selected for, even if these changes also benefit the parasite.},

	abstract = {Until quite recently and since the late 19(th) century, medical microbiology has been based on the assumption that some micro-organisms are pathogens and others are not. This binary view is now strongly criticized and is even becoming untenable. We first provide a historical overview of the changing nature of host-parasite interactions, in which we argue that large-scale sequencing not only shows that identifying the roots of pathogenesis is much more complicated than previously thought, but also forces us to reconsider what a pathogen is. To address the challenge of defining a pathogen in post-genomic science, we present and discuss recent results that embrace the microbial genetic diversity (both within- and between-host) and underline the relevance of microbial ecology and evolution. By analyzing and extending earlier work on the concept of pathogen, we propose pathogenicity (or virulence) should be viewed as a dynamical feature of an interaction between a host and microbes.},

	abstract = {Nearly 40 years ago, Dr. R.J. Gibbons made the first reports of the clinical relevance of what we now know as bacterial biofilms when he published his observations of the role of polysaccharide glycocalyx formation on teeth by Streptococcus mutans [Sci. Am. 238 (1978) 86]. As the clinical relevance of bacterial biofilm formation became increasingly apparent, interest in the phenomenon exploded. Studies are rapidly shedding light on the biomolecular pathways leading to this sessile mode of growth but many fundamental questions remain. The intent of this review is to consider the reasons why bacteria switch from a free-floating to a biofilm mode of growth. The currently available wealth of data pertaining to the molecular genetics of biofilm formation in commonly studied, clinically relevant, single-species biofilms will be discussed in an effort to decipher the motivation behind the transition from planktonic to sessile growth in the human body. Four potential incentives behind the formation of biofilms by bacteria during infection are considered: (1) protection from harmful conditions in the host (defense), (2) sequestration to a nutrient-rich area (colonization), (3) utilization of cooperative benefits (community), (4) biofilms normally grow as biofilms and planktonic cultures are an in vitro artifact (biofilms as the default mode of growth). {\textcopyright} 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

	abstract = {A model of the interactions between populations of temperate and virulent bacteriophage with sensitive, lysogenic, and resistant bacteria is presented. In the analysis of the properties of this model, particular consideration is given to the conditions under which temperate bacteriophage can become established and will be maintained in bacterial populations. The effects of the presence of resistant bacteria and virulent phage on these "existence" conditions for temperate viruses are considered. It is demonstrated that under broad conditions temperate phage will be maintained in bacterial populations and will coexist with virulent phage. Extrapolating from this formal consideration of the population biology of temperate bacteriophage, a number of hypotheses for the conditions under which temperate, rather than virulent, modes of phage reproduction are to be anticipated and the nature of the selective pressures leading to the evolution and persistence of this "benign" type of bacterial virus are reviewed and critically evaluated. Two hypotheses for the "advantages of temperance" are championed: (1) As a consequence of the allelopathic effects of diffusing phage, in physically structured habitats, lysogenic colonies are able to sequester resources and, in that way, have an advantage when competing with sensitive nonlysogens. (2) Lysogeny is an adaptation for phage to maintain their populations in "hard times," when the host bacterial density oscillates below that necessary for phage to be maintained by lytic infection alone. ?? 1984.},

The exact nature of the underlying dynamics is yet under debate and may be determined by recurrent selective sweeps (i.e., arms race dynamics), negative frequency-dependent selection (i.e., Red Queen dynamics), or a combination thereof. These interactions are often associated with reciprocally induced changes in population size, which, in turn, should have a strong impact on co-adaptation processes, yet are neglected in most current work on the topic. Here, we discuss potential consequences of temporal variations in population size on host--parasite coevolution. The limited empirical data available and the current theoretical literature in this field highlight that the consideration of such interaction-dependent population size changes is likely key for the full understanding of the coevolutionary dynamics, and, thus, a more realistic view on the complex nature of species interactions.},

@techreport{Mackinnon2006,
	abstract = {Many parasites evolve to become virulent rather than benign mutualists. One of the major theoretical models of parasite virulence postulates that this is because rapid within-host replication rates are necessary for successful transmission (parasite fitness) and that virulence (damage to the host) is an unavoidable consequence of this rapid replication. Two fundamental assumptions underlying this so-called evolutionary trade-off model have rarely been tested empirically: (1) that higher replication rates lead to higher levels of virulence; and (2) that higher replication rates lead to higher transmission. Both of these relationships must have a genetic basis for this evolutionary hypothesis to be relevant. These assumptions were tested in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, by examining genetic relationships between virulence and transmission traits across a population of eight parasite clones isolated from the wild. Each clone was injected into groups of inbred mice in a controlled laboratory environment, and replication rate (measured by maximum asexual parasitemia), virulence (measured by live-weight loss and degree of anemia in the mouse), and transmission (measured by density of sexual forms, gametocytes, in the blood and proportion of mosquitoes infected after taking a blood-meal from the mouse) were assessed. It was found that clones differed widely in these traits and these clone differences were repeatable over successive blood passages. Virulence traits were strongly phenotypically and genetically (i.e., across clones) correlated to maximum parasitemia thus supporting the first assumption that rapid replication causes higher virulence. Transmission traits were also positively phenotypically and genetically correlated to parasitemia, which supports the second assumption that rapid replication leads to higher transmission. Thus, two assumptions of the parasite-centered trade-off model of the evolution of virulence were shown to be justified in malaria parasites.},

	abstract = {Emergence and re-emergence of pathogens are notoriously difficult to predict. The erratic nature of those events is reinforced by the stochastic nature of pathogen evolution during the early phase of an epidemic. For instance, mutations allowing pathogens to escape host resistance may boost pathogen spread and promote emergence. Yet, the ecological factors that govern such evolutionary emergence remain elusive both because of the lack of ecological realism of current theoretical frameworks and the difficulty of experimentally testing their predictions. Here we develop a theoretical model to explore the effects of the heterogeneity of the host population on the probability of pathogen emergence, with or without pathogen evolution. We show that evolutionary emergence and the spread of escape mutations in the pathogen population is more likely to occur when the host population contains an intermediate proportion of resistant hosts. We also show that lower pathogen inoculum size and higher diversity of host resistance decrease the probability of evolutionary emergence. Crucially, we present experimental confirmations of these predictions using lytic bacteriophages infecting their bacterial hosts containing diverse CRISPR-Cas immune defenses. We discuss the implications of these results for cross-species spillover and for the management of emerging infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific competition describes the negative interaction that occurs when different populations of the same species attempt to fill the same niche. Such competition is predicted to occur among host-associated bacteria but has been challenging to study in natural biological systems. Although many bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri strains exist in seawater, only a few strains are found in the light-organ crypts of an individual wild-caught Euprymna scolopes squid, suggesting a possible role for intraspecific competition during early colonization. Using a culture-based assay to investigate the interactions of different V. fischeri strains, we found ``lethal'' and ``nonlethal'' isolates that could kill or not kill the well-studied light-organ isolate ES114, respectively. The killing phenotype of these lethal strains required a type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded in a 50-kb genomic island. Multiple lethal and nonlethal strains could be cultured from the light organs of individual wild-caught adult squid. Although lethal strains eliminate nonlethal strains in vitro, two lethal strains could coexist in interspersed microcolonies that formed in a T6SS-dependent manner. This coexistence was destabilized upon physical mixing, resulting in one lethal strain consistently eliminating the other. When juvenile squid were coinoculated with lethal and nonlethal strains, they occupied different crypts, yet they were observed to coexist within crypts when T6SS function was disrupted. These findings, using a combination of natural isolates and experimental approaches in vitro and in the animal host, reveal the importance of T6SS in spatially separating strains during the establishment of host colonization in a natural symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Trophically transmitted parasites often alter their intermediate host's phenotype, thereby predisposing hosts to increased predation. This is generally considered to be a parasite strategy evolved to enhance transmission to the next host. However, the adaptive value of host manipulation is not clear, as it may be associated with costs, such as increased susceptibility to predator species that are unsuitable next hosts for the parasites. Thus, it has been proposed that, to be adaptive, manipulation should be specific by predisposing hosts more strongly to predation by target hosts (next host in the life cycle) than to non-hosts. Here we formally evaluate this prediction, and show that manipulation does not have to be specific to be adaptive. However, when manipulation is nonspecific, it needs to effectively increase the overall predation risk of infected hosts if it is to increase the parasite transmission probability. Thus, when initial predation risk is low, even highly nonspecific manipulation strategies can be adaptive. However, when initial predation risk is high, manipulation needs to be more specific to increase parasite transmission success. Therefore, nonspecific host manipulation may evolve in nature, but the adaptive value of a certain manipulation strategy can vary among different parasite populations depending on the variation in initial predation risk.},

A quantitative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilibrium population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Symbiotic relationships between animals and microorganisms are common in nature, yet the factors controlling the abundance and distributions of symbionts are mostly unknown. Aphids have an obligate association with the bacterium Buchnera aphidicola (the primary symbiont) that has been shown to contribute directly to aphid fitness. In addition, aphids sometimes harbor other vertically transmitted bacteria (secondary symbionts), for which few benefits of infection have been previously documented. We carried out experiments to determine the consequences of these facultative symbioses in Acyrthosiphon pisum (the pea aphid) for vulnerability of the aphid host to a hymenopteran parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, a major natural enemy in field populations. Our results show that, in a controlled genetic background, infection confers resistance to parasitoid attack by causing high mortality of developing parasitoid larvae. Compared with uninfected controls, experimentally infected aphids were as likely to be attacked by ovipositing parasitoids but less likely to support parasitoid development. This strong interaction between a symbiotic bacterium and a host natural enemy provides a mechanism for the persistence and spread of symbiotic bacteria.},

	abstract = {More than 10{\%} of insect species, in several taxonomic orders, depend on OBLIGATE BACTERIAL MUTUALISTS for their viability and reproduction 1--5 . These intracellular asso-ciates are called 'primary' (P)-endosymbionts, as they are required for the survival and fecundity of the host. In addition to their ecological importance, P-endosymbionts are ideal systems in which to study the changes in rates and patterns of bacterial evolu-tion that have occurred during the transition from a free-living to an intracellular lifestyle. For example, P-endosymbionts include the smallest, most (A+T)-rich bacterial genomes discovered so far and are quite distinct from the genomes of their free-living close bacterial relatives, which are moderately sized and have moderate percentage G+C contents. Consequently, endosymbionts offer a unique oppor-tunity to examine the molecular and evolutionary forces that drive changes in base composition and genome size in bacteria generally. P-endosymbionts of insects were first characterized through microscopy (for example, see REF. 1); however, because obligate symbionts cannot be readily cultured apart from the host, they have proved difficult to study by using traditional genetic or physiological tech-niques. During the past decade, our understanding of insect endosymbionts has improved markedly through intensive molecular analysis. DNA-sequencing projects have illustrated the mechanisms and consequences of severe genome size reduction among obligate bacterial associates compared with their free-living relatives. Here, I review the insights that molecular and compu-tational approaches have provided into the diversity and significance of insect mutualists, the mechanisms that have led to the reduction in their genome sizes, and the evolutionary implications thereof. I also high-light the parallels that can be drawn between mutual-ists and obligate pathogens, and the more general evolutionary forces that act on the bacterial inhabi-tants of eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {A departure from mainstream biology, the idea of symbiosis---as in the genetic and metabolic interactions of the bacterial communities that became the earliest eukaryotes and eventually evolved into plants and animals---has attracted the attention of a growing number of scientists.These original contributions by symbiosis biologists and evolutionary theorists address the adequacy of the prevailing neo-Darwinian concept of evolution in the light of growing evidence that hereditary symbiosis, supplemented by the gradual accumulation of heritable mutation, results in the origin of new species and morphological novelty. They include reports of current research on the evolutionary consequences of symbiosis, the protracted physical association between organisms of different species. Among the issues considered are individuality and evolution, microbial symbioses, animal-bacterial symbioses, and the importance of symbiosis in cell evolution, ecology, and morphogenesis.Lynn Margulis, Distinguished Professor of Botany at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is the modern originator of the symbiotic theory of cell evolution. Once considered heresy, her ideas are now part of the microbiological revolution.

@article{Crook2014,
	abstract = {How any complex trait has evolved is a fascinating question, yet the evolution of parasitism among the nematodes is arguably one of the most arresting. How did free-living nematodes cross that seemingly insurmountable evolutionary chasm between soil dwelling and survival inside another organism?? Which of the many finely honed responses to the varied and harsh environments of free-living nematodes provided the material upon which natural selection could act?? Although several complementary theories explain this phenomenon, I will focus on the dauer hypothesis. The dauer hypothesis posits that the arrested third-stage dauer larvae of free-living nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans are, due to their many physiological similarities with infective third-stage larvae of parasitic nematodes, a pre-adaptation to parasitism. If so, then a logical extension of this hypothesis is that the molecular pathways which control entry into and recovery from dauer formation by free-living nematodes in response to environmental cues have been co-opted to control the processes of infective larval arrest and activation in parasitic nematodes. The molecular machinery that controls dauer entry and exit is present in a wide range of parasitic nematodes. However, the developmental outputs of the different pathways are both conserved and divergent, not only between populations of C. elegans or between C. elegans and parasitic nematodes but also between different species of parasitic nematodes. Thus the picture that emerges is more nuanced than originally predicted and may provide insights into the evolution of such an interesting and complex trait. ?? 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.},

Water consumption had no effect on human attractiveness to An. gambiae mosquitoes, but beer consumption increased volunteer attractiveness. Body odours of volunteers who consumed beer increased mosquito activation (proportion of mosquitoes engaging in take-off and up-wind flight) and orientation (proportion of mosquitoes flying towards volunteers' odours). The level of exhaled carbon dioxide and body temperature had no effect on human attractiveness to mosquitoes. Despite individual volunteer variation, beer consumption consistently increased attractiveness to mosquitoes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that beer consumption is a risk factor for malaria and needs to be integrated into public health policies for the design of control measures.},

BODIPY 558/568 phalloidin and Alexa 488 phalloidin resolved a meshwork of ribbon-shaped body-wall muscles as well as inner-body musculature associated with the pharynx and male copulatory organ. The general pattern of body-wall muscles in U. cyprinae is similar to that of other rhabdocoel turbellarians in consisting only of circular, longitudinal, and diagonal fibers; the arrangement of these muscles readily correlates with the bending motions the animal undergoes as it feeds at the surface of gills in bivalves it parasitizes. The orogenital atrium of U. cyprinae lies at the posterior apex of the body, opening at a terminal pore. As evidenced by the arrangement of its epithelium and musculature, it appears to be an invagination of the body wall and comes closest of any such duct studied in turbellarians to satisfying the hypothetical model of a "pseudopharynx," ostensibly adapted as an organ for swallowing and so supplementing the ingestive role of the animal's true pharynx.},

The absence of the cell wall so characteristic of plants and fungi and the commonly large size of most protozoa are additional factors favoring protozoan cells for endosymbioses. The conversion of symbiont into a cellular organelle (e.g. a mitochondrion or chloroplast) is more complicated, especially since the latter do not code for all of their own proteins, Thus, such conversions are held to be rare. Among protozoa, numerous foraminifera appear to have characteristics making them very favorable as hosts for certain algae. Such adaptations, both physiological and morphological in nature, are discussed. Also discussed in this paper are the ways by which (present-day) chloroplasts and mitochondria may have been derived from early endosymbionts: a single ancestral cyanobacterium, in the first case, and a single ancestral purple-nonsulfur bacterium, in the second. Mechanisms for insertion of proteins into and across the organellar membranes had to be evolved for all genes transferred from the symbionts into the host nucleus.},

Previous theory has illuminated conditions that favor the evolution of increased or decreased ploidy but has shed little light on which species should be primarily haploid and which primarily diploid. Here, we report a discovery that emerged from host-parasite models in which ploidy levels were allowed to evolve: selection is more likely to favor diploidy in host species and haploidy in parasite species. Essentially, when parasites must evade a host's immune system or defense response, selection favors parasitic individuals that express a narrow array of antigens and elicitors, thus favoring haploid parasites over diploid parasites. Conversely, when hosts must recognize a parasite before mounting a defensive response, selection favors hosts with a broader arsenal of recognition molecules, thus favoring diploid hosts over haploid hosts. These results are consistent with the predominance of haploidy among parasitic protists.},

Methods: An entomological survey was carried out from May to December 2008 in Dioulassoba and Kodeni (central and peripheral districts respectively), which are representative of the main ecological features of the city. Sampling consisted of the collection of larval stages from water bodies, and adults by monthly indoor residual spraying (IRS) using aerosol insecticides. Insecticide susceptibility tests were performed using the WHO filter paper protocol on adults emerged from larvae. PCR was used to determine vector species and to identify resistance mechanisms (kdr and ace-1 R). The Plasmodium infection rate was estimated by ELISA performed on female mosquitoes collected indoors by IRS. Results: An. arabiensis was found to be the major malaria vector in Bobo-Dioulasso, comprising 50 to 100{\%} of the vector population. The sporozoite infection rate for An. arabiensis was higher than An. gambiae s.s. at both Dioulassoba and Kodeni. An. gambiae s.l. was resistant to DDT and cross-resistant to pyrethroids at the two sites with higher levels of resistance observed in An. gambiae s.s. than An. arabiensis. Resistance to 0.1{\%} bendiocarb was observed in the An. gambiae s.s. S form but not the M form or in An. arabiensis. The L1014F kdr mutation was detected in the two molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. at varying frequencies (0.45 to 0.92), but was not detected in An. arabiensis, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in DDT resistance in this species. The ace-1 R mutation was only detected in the S molecular form and was observed at the two sites at similar frequency (0.3). Conclusions: Over the last ten years, An. arabiensis has become the major malaria vector in Bobo-Dioulasso city where it was formerly present only at low frequency. However, the ecological determinant that enhances the settlement of this species into urban and peri-urban areas of Bobo-Dioulasso remains to be clarified. The impact of the changing An. gambiae s.l. population in this region for vector control including resistance management strategies is discussed.},

Here we perform a meta-analysis of all sequenced genomes of nematodes and Platyhelminthes, and attempt to address the question of what are the defining characteristics of helminth genomes. We find that parasitic worms lack systems for surface antigenic variation, instead maintaining infections using their surfaces as the first line of defence against the host immune system, with several expanded gene families of genes associated with the surface and tegument. Parasite excretory/secretory products evolve rapidly, and proteases even more so, with each parasite exhibiting unique modifications of its protease repertoire. Endoparasitic flatworms show striking losses of metabolic capabilities, not matched by nematodes. All helminths do however exhibit an overall reduction in auxiliary metabolism (biogenesis of co-factors and vitamins). Overall, the prevailing pattern is that there are few commonalities between the genomes of independently evolved parasitic worms, with each parasite having undergone specific adaptations for their particular niche.},

@techreport{Ganusov2002,
	abstract = {Why do parasites harm their hosts? The general understanding is that if the transmission rate and virulence of a parasite are linked, then the parasite must harm its host to maximize its transmission. The exact nature of such trade-offs remains largely unclear, but for vertebrate hosts it probably involves interactions between a microparasite and the host immune system. Previous results have suggested that in a homogeneous host population in the absence of super-or coinfection, within-host dynamics lead to selection of the parasite with an intermediate growth rate that is just being controlled by the immune system before it kills the host (Antia et al. 1994). In this paper, we examine how this result changes when heterogeneity is introduced to the host population. We incorporate the simplest form of heterogeneity-random heterogeneity in the parameters describing the size of the initial parasite inoculum, the immune response of the host, and the lethal density at which the parasite kills the host. We find that the general conclusion of the previous model holds: parasites evolve some intermediate growth rate. However, in contrast with the generally accepted view, we find that virulence (measured by the case mortality or the rate of parasite-induced host mortality) increases with heterogeneity. Finally, we link the within-host and between-host dynamics of parasites. We show how the parameters for epidemiological spread of the disease can be estimated from the within-host dynamics, and in doing so examine the way in which trade-offs between these epidemiological parameters arise as a consequence of the interaction of the parasite and the immune response of the host.},

@article{VanDyken2012,
	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of altruism requires knowledge of both its constraints and its drivers. Here we show that, paradoxically, ecological constraints on altruism may ultimately be its strongest driver. We construct a two-trait, coevolutionary adaptive dynamics model of social evolution in a genetically structured population with local resource competition. The intensity of local resource competition, which influences the direction and strength of social selection and which is typically treated as a static parameter, is here allowed to be an evolvable trait. Evolution of survival/fecundity altruism, which requires weak local competition, increases local competition as it evolves, creating negative environmental feedback that ultimately inhibits its further evolutionary advance. Alternatively, evolution of resource-based altruism, which requires strong local competition, weakens local competition as it evolves, also ultimately causing its own evolution to stall. When evolving independently, these altruistic strategies are intrinsically self-limiting. However, the coexistence of these two altruism types transforms the negative ecoevolutionary feedback generated by each strategy on itself into positive feedback on the other, allowing the presence of one trait to drive the evolution of the other. We call this feedback conversion "reciprocal niche construction." In the absence of constraints, this process leads to runaway coevolution of altruism types. We discuss applications to the origins and evolution of eusociality, division of labor, the inordinate ecological success of eusocial species, and the interaction between technology and demography in human evolution. Our theory suggests that the evolution of extreme sociality may often be an autocatalytic process.},

@article{DeRoode2008,
	abstract = {Why do parasites harm their hosts? Conventional wisdom holds that because parasites depend on their hosts for survival and transmission, they should evolve to become benign, yet many parasites cause harm. Theory predicts that parasites could evolve virulence (i.e., parasite-induced reductions in host fitness) by balancing the transmission benefits of parasite replication with the costs of host death. This idea has led researchers to predict how human interventions-such as vaccines-may alter virulence evolution, yet empirical support is critically lacking. We studied a protozoan parasite of monarch butterflies and found that higher levels of within-host replication resulted in both higher virulence and greater transmission, thus lending support to the idea that selection for parasite transmission can favor parasite genotypes that cause substantial harm. Parasite fitness was maximized at an intermediate level of parasite replication, beyond which the cost of increased host mortality outweighed the benefit of increased transmission. A separate experiment confirmed genetic relationships between parasite replication and virulence, and showed that parasite genotypes from two monarch populations caused different virulence. These results show that selection on parasite transmission can explain why parasites harm their hosts, and suggest that constraints imposed by host ecology can lead to population divergence in parasite virulence.},

We proved that vegetative cells of B. cereus sl are widely distributed in fresh water of rivers and lakes being as common as spores. Moreover, heavy rain shows huge impact on their concentration in undisturbed environments. The diversity of B. cereus sl reflects multiple sources of bacteria and differences between distinct environments. Next, their diverse genetic structure and phenotypes better fit to their ecological properties than to the taxonomic affiliation.},

@article{Braendle2003,
	abstract = {Symbiotic relationships between bacteria and insect hosts are common. Although the bacterial endosymbionts have been subjected to intense investigation, little is known of the host cells in which they reside, the bacteriocytes. We have studied the development and evolution of aphid bacteriocytes, the host cells that contain the endosymbiotic bacteria Buchnera aphidicola. We show that bacteriocytes of Acyrthosiphon pisum express several gene products (or their paralogues): Distal-less, Ultrabithorax/Abdominal-A, and Engrailed. Using these markers, we find that a subpopulation of the bacteriocytes is specified prior to the transmission of maternal bacteria to the embryo. In addition, we discovered that a second population of cells is recruited to the bacteriocyte fate later in development. We experimentally demonstrate that bacteriocyte induction and proliferation occur independently of B. aphidicola. Major features of bacteriocyte development, including the two-step recruitment of bacteriocytes, have been conserved in aphids for 80-150 million years. Furthermore, we have investigated two cases of evolutionary loss of bacterial symbionts: in one case, where novel extracellular, eukaryotic symbionts replaced the bacteria, the bacteriocyte is maintained; in another case, where symbionts are absent, the bacteriocytes are initiated but not maintained. The bacteriocyte represents an evolutionarily novel cell fate, which is developmentally determined independently of the bacteria. Three of five transcription factors we examined show novel expression patterns in bacteriocytes, suggesting that bacteriocytes may have evolved to express many additional transcription factors. The evolutionary transition to a symbiosis in which bacteria and an aphid cell form a functional unit, similar to the origin of plastids, has apparently involved extensive molecular adaptations on the part of the host cell.},

	abstract = {Do malaria parasites enhance the attractiveness of humans to the parasite's vector? As such manipulation would have important implications for the epidemiology of the disease, the question has been debated for many years. To investigate the issue in a semi-natural situation, we assayed the attractiveness of 12 groups of three western Kenyan children to the main African malaria vector, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. In each group, one child was uninfected, one was naturally infected with the asexual (non-infective) stage of Plasmodium falciparum, and one harboured the parasite's gametocytes (the stage transmissible to mosquitoes). The children harbouring gametocytes attracted about twice as many mosquitoes as the two other classes of children. In a second assay of the same children, when the parasites had been cleared with anti-malarial treatment, the attractiveness was similar between the three classes of children. In particular, the children who had previously harboured gametocytes, but had now cleared the parasite, were not more attractive than other children. This ruled out the possibility of a bias due to differential intrinsic attractiveness of the children to mosquitoes and strongly suggests that gametocytes increase the attractiveness of the children.},

Indeed, non-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes probed for a shorter period than did either sporozoite-infected or saliva-deprived mosquitoes. Salivary apyrase activity is reduced to a third following maturation of sporozoites. Apyrase activity, normally, is confined to those regions invaded by sporozoites. Sporozoite-infected and non-infected mosquitoes produced equal volumes of saliva. We conclude that sporozoite infection impairs the vector's ability to locate blood vessels by affecting the quality of salivary product, thereby increasing potentially infective host contacts.},

When plants were grown in this same soil with added P, leaf areas of M and NM plants were similar. When plants were grown in a soil of moderate P availability (15 $\mu$g g−1), infection decreased leaf area throughout the experiment. High soil P levels were associated with lower degrees of infection. The degree of infection was positively correlated with the degree of depression of leaf area while the soil P level was negatively correlated with the ability to overcome the initial depression. When M and NM plants were grown in the soils of either low or moderate P availability, the relationship between relative leaf expansion rate RLER and tissue P concentration was the same for M and NM plants. Also, mycorrhizal infection did not affect plant N concentration to the same degree as it did P concentration. When grown in the soil of low P availability, dry matter in the shoot was shown to be partitioned differently for M and NM plants. M plants in vested mo re dry matter in leaves relative to stems compared to NM plants. Phosphorus‐amended NM plants also invested more dry matter in leaves relative to stems compared to unamended NM plants. Because of the possible difference in leaf dry weight: stem dry weight ratio between M and NM plants, final harvest shoot dry weights were not an adequate measure of the physiological status of the plants.

	abstract = {Many natural enemies employ plant- and/or herbivore-derived signals for host/prey location. The larval parasitoid Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is 1 of 3 biocontrol agents currently being released in an effort to control the emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coloeptera: Burprestidae) in North America. To enhance its efficiency, allelochemicals that attract it need to be assessed. In this study, ash phloem volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of black, green, and white ash, and EAB larval frass were compared. Foraging behavior of T. planipennisi females in response to VOCs of white ash or frass from EAB larvae feeding on white ash phloem was tested using a Y-tube olfactometer. Results indicated that the 3 ash species had similar VOC profiles. EAB larval frass generally contained greater levels of VOCs than phloem. Factor analysis indicated that the 11 VOCs could be broadly divided into 2 groups, with alpha-bisabolol, beta-caryophyllene, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenal, limonene, methyl benzoate, methyl indole-3-acetic acid, methyl jasmonate, methyl salicylate as the first group and the rest (i.e., methyl linoleate and methyl linolenate) as a second. Abundance of VOCs in white ash phloem tissue and frass, nevertheless, did not attract T. planipennisi females. The concealed feeding of EAB larvae might explain the selection for detectable and reliable virbrational signals, instead of undetectable and relatively unreliable VOC cues from phloem and frass, in short-range foraging by T. planipennisi. Alternatively, it is possible that T. planipennisi is not amenable to the Y-tube olfactometer assay employed.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic alterations induced by parasites in their intermediate hosts often result in enhanced trophic transmission to appropriate final hosts. However, such alterations may also increase the vulnerability of intermediate hosts to predation by non-host species. We studied the influence of both infection with 3 different acanthocephalan parasites (Pomphorhynchus laevis, P. tereticollis, and Polymorphus minutus) and the availability of refuges on the susceptibility of the amphipod Gammarus pulex to predation by 2 non-host predators in microcosms. Only infection with P. laevis increased the vulnerability of amphipods to predation by crayfish, Orconectes limosus. In contrast, in the absence of refuges, the selectivity of water scorpions, Nepa cinerea, for infected prey was significant and did not differ according to parasite species. When a refuge was available for infected prey, however, water scorpion selectivity for infected prey differed between parasite species. Both P. tereticollis- and P. laevis-infected gammarids were more vulnerable than uninfected ones, whereas the reverse was true of P. minutus-infected gammarids. These results suggest that the true consequences of phenotypic changes associated with parasitic infection in terms of increased trophic transmission of parasites deserve further assessment.},

@techreport{Metz1996a,
	abstract = {We set out to explore a class of stochastic processes called, 'adaptive dynamics', which supposedly capture some of the essentials of the long-term biological evolution. These processes have a strong deterministic component. This allows a classification of their qualitative features which in many aspects is similar to classifications from the theory of deterministic dynamical systems. But, they also display a good number of clear-cut novel dynamical phenomena. The sample functions of an adaptive dynamics are piece-wise constant function from R+ to the finite subsets of some 'trait' space X in R k. Those subsets we call 'adaptive conditions'. Both the range and the jumps of a sample function are governed by a function s, called 'fitness', mapping the present adaptive condition and the trait value of a potential 'mutant' to R. Sign(s) tell us which subsets of X qualify as adaptive conditions, which mutants can potentially 'invade', leading to a jump in the sample function, and which adaptive condition(s) can result from such invasion. Fitness supposedly satisfy certain constraints derived from their population/ community dynamical origin, such as the fact that all mutants which are equal to some 'residents', i.e., element of the present adaptive condition, have zero fitness. Apart from that, we suppose that s is as smooth as can be possibly condoned by its community dynamical origin. Moreover, we assume that a mutant can differ but little from its resident 'progenitor'. In Sections 1 and 2, we describe the biological background of our mathematical framework. In Section 1, we deal with the position of our framework relative to present and past evolutionary research. In Section 2, we discuss the community dynamical origin of s, and the reason for making a number of specific simplifications relative to the full complexity seen in nature. In Sections 3 and 4, we consider some general, mathematical, as well as biological conclusions that can be drawn from our frame work in its simplest guise, that is, when we assume that X is 1-dimensional, and that the cardinality of the adaptive conditions stays low. The main result is a classification of the adaptively singular points. These points comprise both the adaptive point attractors, as well as the points where the adaptive trajectory can branch; thus, attaining its characteristic tree-like shape. In Section 5, we discuss how adaptive dynamics relate through a limiting argument to stochastic models in which individual organisms are represented as separate entities. It is only through such a limiting procedure that any class of population or evolutionary models can eventually be justified. Our basic assumptions are : (i) clonal reproduction, i.e., the resident individuals reproduce faithfully without any of the complications of sex or Mendelian genetics, except for the occasional occurrence of a mutant, (ii) a large system size and an even rarer occurrence of mutations per birth event, (iii) uniqueness and global attractiveness of any interior attractor of the community dynamics in the limit of the infinite system size. In Section 6, we try to delineate, by a tentative listing of 'axioms', the largest possible class of processes that can result from the kind of limiting considerations spelled out in Section 5. And in Section 7, we heuristically derive some very general predictions about macro-evolutionary patterns, based on those weak assumptions only. In the final Section 8, we discuss (i) how the results from the preceding sections may fit into a more encompassing view of biological evolution, and (ii) some directions for further research.},

@article{Cavalier-Smith2009,
	abstract = {Cells are of only two kinds: bacteria, with DNA segregated by surface membrane motors, dating back ∼3.5 Gy; and eukaryotes, which evolved from bacteria, possibly as recently as 800-850 My ago. The last common ancestor of eukaryotes was a sexual phagotrophic protozoan with mitochondria, one or two centrioles and cilia. Conversion of bacteria ( = prokaryotes) into a eukaryote involved ∼60 major innovations. Numerous contradictory ideas about eukaryogenesis fail to explain fundamental features of eukaryotic cell biology or conflict with phylogeny. Data are best explained by the intracellular coevolutionary theory, with three basic tenets: (1) the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and endomembrane system originated through cooperatively enabling the evolution of phagotrophy; (2) phagocytosis internalised DNA-membrane attachments, unavoidably disrupting bacterial division; recovery entailed the evolution of the nucleus and mitotic cycle; (3) the symbiogenetic origin of mitochondria immediately followed the perfection of phagotrophy and intracellular digestion, contributing greater energy efficiency and group II introns as precursors of spliceosomal introns. Eukaryotes plus their archaebacterial sisters form the clade neomura, which evolved from a radically modified derivative of an actinobacterial posibacterium that had replaced the ancestral eubacterial murein peptidoglycan by N-linked glycoproteins, radically modified its DNA-handling enzymes, and evolved cotranslational protein secretion, but not the isoprenoid-ether lipids of archaebacteria. I focus on this phylogenetic background and on explaining how in response to novel phagotrophic selective pressures and ensuing genome internalisation this prekaryote evolved efficient digestion of prey proteins by retrotranslocation and 26S proteasomes, then internal digestion by phagocytosis, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, and eukaryotic vesicle trafficking and intracellular compartmentation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is known that frequency-dependent selection, generating advantages for rare types, can maintain genetic variation and lead to speciation, but in models with simple phenotypes (that is, low-dimensional phenotype spaces), frequency dependence needs to be strong to generate diversity. However, we show that if the ecological properties of an organism are determined by multiple traits with complex interactions, the conditions needed for frequency-dependent selection to generate diversity are relaxed to the point where they are easily satisfied in high-dimensional phenotype spaces. Mathematically, this phenomenon is reflected in properties of eigenvalues of quadratic forms. Because all living organisms have at least hundreds of phenotypes, this casts the potential importance of frequency dependence for the origin and maintenance of diversity in a new light.},

	abstract = {The hermit crab Dardanus pedunculatus and the sea anemone Calliactis tricolor engage in a mutualistic relationship in the tropical reef ecosystem of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. This mutualism is shaped by the pressures on D. pedunculatus individuals to acquire actively and compete for C. tricolor in the wild. D. pedunculatus exhibits a consistent trend in behavior when competing for and placing C. tricolor on its gastropod shell. Since C. tricolor seems to be a valuable resource to D. pedunculatus, this species engages in intraspecific competition. Experiments were designed to examine the behaviors of D. pedunculatus under laboratory conditions when competing for and placing their symbiont. D. pedunculatus individuals steal C. tricolor from one another, with larger D. pedunculatus dominating in these encounters. In contests between two D. pedunculatus individuals, competition is also based on size dominance. The size of the cheliped of the left-handed D. pedunculatus is the most strongly correlated to winning a fight for C. tricolor. The placement of C. tricolor follows a distinctive symmetrical pattern on the shell of D. pedunculatus. By equally distributing C. tricolor, D. pedunculatus could possibly be protecting itself from attack coming at any angle. These behaviors stem from the benefits that both organisms derive from their union. Understanding the behavioral patterns linked to this symbiotic relationship helps to examine the broader web of interactions that build the complexity of reef ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Mutualism among species is ubiquitous in natural ecosystems but its evolution is not well understood. We provided a simple lattice model to clarify the importance of spatial structure for the evolution of mutualism. We assumed reproductive rates of two species are modified through interaction between species and examine conditions where mutualists of both species, that give some benefit to the other species with their own cost, invade non-mutualists populations. When dispersal of offspring is unlimited, we verified the evolution of mutualism is impossible under any condition. On the other hand, when the dispersal is limited to neighboring lattice sites, mutualists can invade if the ratio of cost to benefit is low and the intrinsic reproductive rate is low in case where the parameter values are symmetric between species. Under the same conditions, non-mutualists cannot invade mutualist populations, that is, the latter are evolutionarily stable. In case of asymmetric parameters, mutualists tend to invade if the average value of costs to two species is low or that of benefits is high, and if the intrinsic reproductive rate is low for one of the two species. A mechanistic explanation of why mutualists increase when the dispersal is limited is given by showing that mutualist pairs of the two species at the same lattice site rapidly increase at the initial phase of the invasion. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Environmental variability and adaptive foraging behavior have been shown to favor coexistence of specialists and generalists on an ecological timescale. This leaves unaddressed the question of whether such coexistence can also be expected on an evolutionary timescale. In this article, we study the attainability, through gradual evolution, of specialist-generalist coexistence, as well as the evolutionary stability of such communities when allowing for immigration. Our analysis shows that the potential for specialist-generalist coexistence is much more restricted than originally thought and strongly depends on the trade-off structure assumed. We establish that ecological coexistence is less likely for species facing a trade-off between per capita reproduction in different habitats than when the trade-off acts on carrying capacities alone. We also demonstrate that coexistence is evolutionarily stable whenever it is ecologically stable but that in most cases, such coexistence cannot be reached through gradual evolution. We conclude that an evolutionarily stable community of specialists and generalists may be created only through immigration from elsewhere or through mutations of large effect. Our results highlight that trade-offs in fitness-determining traits can have counterintuitive effects on the evolution of specialization.},

However, current consumer-resource models do not take into account competition between resources or only incorporate intraspecific competition phenomenologically with, for example, a logistic growth function. Here, we mechanistically incorporate competition in an existing two-resource model, by introducing nutrient-limited resource growth and setting the total amount of nutrients (free or contained in consumers and resources) to a fixed value. In addition to the three combinations of generalists and specialists found in previous models, we find four other evolutionary outcomes, depending on the strength of the consumer trade-off: coexistence of one specialist and a generalist and three types of evolutionary cycling. Furthermore, which outcomes are most likely depends strongly on the combination of intrinsic growth rate of resources and the total amount of nutrients in the system. Our results suggest that the realistic assumption of nutrient competition may shed new light on the evolution of the multitude of strategies in real systems.},

	abstract = {Variation among parasite strains can affect the progression of disease or the effectiveness of treatment. What maintains parasite diversity? Here I argue that competition among parasites within the host is a major cause of variation among parasites. The competitive environment within the host can vary depending on the parasite genotypes present. For example, parasite strategies that target specific competitors, such as bacteriocins, are dependent on the presence and susceptibility of those competitors for success. Accordingly, which parasite traits are favoured by within-host selection can vary from host to host. Given the fluctuating fitness landscape across hosts, genotype by genotype (GxG) interactions among parasites should be prevalent. Moreover, selection should vary in a frequency-dependent manner, as attacking genotypes select for resistance and genotypes producing public goods select for cheaters. I review competitive coexistence theory with regard to parasites and highlight a few key examples where within-host competition promotes diversity. Finally, I discuss how within-host competition affects host health and our ability to successfully treat infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease that kills almost one million persons each year, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. P. falciparum is transmitted to the human host by the bite of an Anopheles female mosquito, and Anopheles gambiae sensus stricto is the most tremendous malaria vector in Africa, widespread throughout the afro-tropical belt. An. gambiae s.s. is subdivided into two distinct molecular forms, namely M and S forms. The two molecular forms are morphologically identical but they are distinct genetically, and differ by their distribution and their ecological preferences. The epidemiological importance of the two molecular forms in malaria transmission has been poorly investigated so far and gave distinct results in different areas. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, and used it to detect P. falciparum at the oocyst stage in wild An. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes experimentally infected with natural isolates of parasites. Mosquitoes were collected at immature stages in sympatric and allopatric breeding sites and further infected at the adult stage. We next measured the infection prevalence and intensity in female mosquitoes using the qPCR assay and correlated the infection success with the mosquito molecular forms. Our results revealed different prevalence of infection between the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. in Cameroon, for both sympatric and allopatric populations of mosquitoes. However, no difference in the infection intensity was observed. Thus, the distribution of the molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. may impact on the malaria epidemiology, and it will be important to monitor the efficiency of malaria control interventions on the two M and S forms.},

Holobionts can be considered levels of selection in evolution because they are well-defined interactors, replicators/reproducers, and manifestors of adaptation. An initial mathematical model is presented to help understand how holobionts evolve. The model offered combines the processes of horizontal symbiont transfer, within-host symbiont proliferation, vertical symbiont transmission, and holobiont selection. The model offers equations for the population dynamics and evolution of holobionts whose hologenomes differ in gene copy number, not in allelic or loci identity. The model may readily be extended to include variation among holobionts in the gene identities of both symbionts and host.},

	abstract = {Parasites are thought to play an important role in sexual selection and the evolution of mating strategies, which in turn are likely to be critical to the transmission and therefore the evolution of parasites. Despite this clear interdependence we have little understanding of parasite-mediated sexual selection in the context of reciprocal parasite evolution. Here we develop a general coevolutionary model between host mate preference and the virulence of a sexually transmitted parasite. We show when the characteristics of both the host and parasite lead to coevolutionarily stable strategies or runaway selection, and when coevolutionary cycling between high and low levels of host mate choosiness and virulence is possible. A prominent argument against parasites being involved in sexual selection is that they should evolve to become less virulent when transmission depends on host mating success. The present study, however, demonstrates that coevolution can maintain stable host mate choosiness and parasite virulence or indeed coevolutionary cycling of both traits. We predict that choosiness should vary inversely with parasite virulence and that both relatively long and short life spans select against choosy behavior in the host. The model also reveals that hosts can evolve different behavioral responses from the same initial conditions, which highlights difficulties in using comparative analysis to detect parasitemediated sexual selection. Taken as a whole, our results emphasize the importance of viewing parasite-mediated sexual selection in the context of coevolution.},

	abstract = {The impressive body of work on the major evolutionary transitions in the last 20 y calls for a reconstruction of the theory although a 2D account (evolution of informational systems and transitions in individuality) remains. Significant advances include the concept of fraternal and egalitarian transitions (lower-level units like and unlike, respectively). Multilevel selection, first without, then with, the collectives in focus is an important explanatory mechanism. Transitions are decomposed into phases of origin, maintenance, and transformation (i.e., further evolution) of the higher level units, which helps reduce the number of transitions in the revised list by two so that it is less top-heavy. After the transition, units show strong cooperation and very limited realized conflict. The origins of cells, the emergence of the genetic code and translation, the evolution of the eukaryotic cell, multicellularity, and the origin of human groups with language are reconsidered in some detail in the light of new data and considerations. Arguments are given why sex is not in the revised list as a separate transition. Some of the transitions can be recursive (e.g., plastids, multicellularity) or limited (transitions that share the usual features of major transitions without a massive phylogenetic impact, such as the micro- and macronuclei in ciliates). During transitions, new units of reproduction emerge, and establishment of such units requires high fidelity of reproduction (as opposed to mere replication).},

	abstract = {Coevolution is relentlessly creating and maintaining biodiversity and therefore has been a central topic in evolutionary biology. Previous theoretical studies have mostly considered coevolution between genetically symmetric traits (i.e. coevolution between two continuous quantitative traits or two discrete Mendelian traits). However, recent empirical evidence indicates that coevolution can occur between genetically asymmetric traits (e.g. between quantitative and Mendelian traits). We examine consequences of antagonistic coevolution mediated by a quantitative predator trait and a Mendelian prey trait, such that predation is more intense with decreased phenotypic distance between their traits (phenotype matching). This antagonistic coevolution produces a complex pattern of bifurcations with bistability (initial state dependence) in a two-dimensional model for trait coevolution. Furthermore, with eco-evolutionary dynamics (so that the trait evolution affects predator-prey population dynamics), we find that coevolution can cause rich dynamics including anti-phase cycles, in-phase cycles, chaotic dynamics and deterministic predator extinction. Predator extinction is more likely to occur when the prey trait exhibits complete dominance rather than semidominance and when the predator trait evolves very rapidly. Our study illustrates how recognizing the genetic architectures of interacting ecological traits can be essential for understanding the population and evolutionary dynamics of coevolving species.},

We argue that within-host interactions between parasites largely determine how virulence evolves and that experimental data support model predictions. Then, we explore the main limitation of the experimental study of such 'mixed infections', which is that it draws conclusions on evolutionary outcomes from studies conducted at the individual level. We also discuss differences between coinfections caused by different strains of the same species or by different species. Overall, we argue that it is possible to make sense out of the complexity inherent to multiple infections and that experimental evolution settings may provide the best opportunity to further our understanding of virulence evolution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) are homoplasy-free and co-dominant genetic markers which are considered to represent useful tools for population genetic studies, and could help clarifying the speciation processes ongoing within the major malaria vector in Africa, Anopheles gambiae s.s. Here, we report the results of the analysis of the insertion polymorphism of a nearly 200 bp-long SINE (SINE200) within genome areas of high differentiation (i.e. "speciation islands") of M and S A. gambiae molecular forms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A SINE-PCR approach was carried out on thirteen SINE200 insertions in M and S females collected along the whole range of distribution of A. gambiae s.s. in sub-Saharan Africa. Ten specimens each for Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles melas, Anopheles quadriannulatus A and 15 M/S hybrids from laboratory crosses were also analysed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Eight loci were successfully amplified and were found to be specific for A. gambiae s.s.: 5 on 2L chromosome and one on X chromosome resulted monomorphic, while two loci positioned respectively on 2R (i.e. S200 2R12D) and X (i.e. S200 X6.1) chromosomes were found to be polymorphic. S200 2R12D was homozygote for the insertion in most S-form samples, while intermediate levels of polymorphism were shown in M-form, resulting in an overall high degree of genetic differentiation between molecular forms (Fst = 0.46 p {\textless} 0.001) and within M-form (Fst = 0.46 p {\textless} 0.001). The insertion of S200 X6.1 was found to be fixed in all M- and absent in all S-specimens. This led to develop a novel easy-to-use PCR approach to straightforwardly identify A. gambiae molecular forms. This novel approach allows to overcome the constraints associated with markers on the rDNA region commonly used for M and S identification. In fact, it is based on a single copy and irreversible SINE200 insertion and, thus, is not subjected to peculiar evolutionary patterns affecting rDNA markers, e.g. incomplete homogenization of the arrays through concerted evolution and/or mixtures of M and S IGS-sequences among the arrays of single chromatids.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The approach utilized allowed to develop new easy-to-use co-dominant markers for the analysis of genetic differentiation between M and S-forms and opens new perspectives in the study of the speciation process ongoing within A. gambiae.},

@article{Frank1996,
	abstract = {Several evolutionary processes influence virulence, the amount of damage a parasite causes to its host. For example, parasites are favored to exploit their hosts prudently to prolong infection and avoid killing the host. Parasites also need to use some host resources to reproduce and transmit infections to new hosts. Thus parasites face a tradeoff between prudent exploitation and rapid reproduction-a life history tradeoff between longevity and fecundity. Other tradeoffs among components of parasite fitness also influence virulence. For example, competition among parasite genotypes favors rapid growth to achieve greater relative success within the host. Rapid growth may, however, lower the total productivity of the local group by overexploiting the host, which is a potentially renewable food supply. This is a problem of kin selection and group selection. I summarize models of parasite virulence with the theoretical tools of life history analysis, kin selection, and epidemiology. I then apply the theory to recent empirical studies and models of virulence. These applications, to nematodes, to the extreme virulence of hospital epidemics, and to bacterial meningitis, show the power of simple life history theory to highlight interesting questions and to provide a rich array of hypotheses. These examples also show the kinds of conceptual mistakes that commonly arise when only a few components of parasite fitness are analysed in isolation. The last part of the article connects standard models of parasite virulence to diverse topics, such as the virulence of bacterial plasmids, the evolution of genomes, and the processes that influenced conflict and cooperation among the earliest replicators near the origin of life.},

	abstract = {Endosymbiosis plays an important role in ecology and evolution, but fundamental aspects of the origin of intracellular symbionts remain unclear. The extreme age of many symbiotic relationships, lack of data on free-living ancestors and uniqueness of each event hinder investigations. Here, we describe multiple strains of the bacterium Polynucleobacter that evolved independently and under similar conditions from closely related, free-living ancestors to become obligate endosymbionts of closely related ciliate hosts. As these genomes reduced in parallel from similar starting states, they provide unique glimpses into the mechanisms underlying genome reduction in symbionts. We found that gene loss is contingently lineage-specific, with no evidence for ordered streamlining. However, some genes in otherwise disrupted pathways are retained, possibly reflecting cryptic genetic network complexity. We also measured substitution rates between many endosymbiotic and free-living pairs for hundreds of genes, which showed that genetic drift, and not mutation pressure, is the main non-selective factor driving molecular evolution in endosymbionts.},

@article{Madgwick,
	abstract = {Contributing to cooperation is typically costly, while its rewards are often available to all members of a social group. So why should individuals be willing to pay these costs, especially if they could cheat by exploiting the investments of others? Kin selection theory broadly predicts that individuals should invest more into cooperation if their relatedness to group members is high (assuming they can discriminate kin from nonkin). To better understand how relatedness affects cooperation, we derived the ``Collective Investment" game, which provides quantitative predictions for patterns of strategic investment depending on the level of relatedness. We then tested these predictions by experimentally manipulating relatedness (genotype frequencies) in mixed cooperative aggregations of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, which builds a stalk to facilitate spore dispersal. Measurements of stalk investment by natural strains correspond to the predicted patterns of relatedness-dependent strategic investment, wherein investment by a strain increases with its relatedness to the group. Furthermore, if overall group relatedness is relatively low (i.e., no strain is at high frequency in a group) strains face a scenario akin to the "Prisoner's Dilemma" and suffer from insufficient collective investment. We find that strains employ relatedness-dependent segregation to avoid these pernicious conditions. These findings demonstrate that simple organisms like D. discoideum are not restricted to being ``cheaters" or ``cooperators" but instead measure their relatedness to their group and strategically modulate their investment into cooperation accordingly. Consequently, all individuals will sometimes appear to cooperate and sometimes cheat due to the dynamics of strategic investing.},

	abstract = {Many species of disease-vector mosquitoes display vertebrate host specificity. Despite considerable progress in recent years in understanding the proximate and ultimate factors related to non-random host selection at the interspecific level, the basis of this selection remains only partially understood. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, the main malaria vector in Africa, is considered a highly anthropophilic mosquito, and host odours have been shown to play a major role in the host-seeking process of this species. Studies on host preference of An. gambiae have been either conducted in controlled conditions using laboratory reared mosquitoes and worn stockings as host-related stimuli, or have been done in the field with methods that do not account for internal (e.g. age of sampled mosquitoes) and/or environmental effects. We explored differential behavioural responses to host odours between two populations of the same sibling species, An. gambiae in semi-field conditions in Burkina Faso. The behavioural responses (i.e. degree of activation and strength of anemotaxis) were investigated using a Y-olfactometer designed to accommodate whole hosts as a source of odour stimuli. Two strains of An. gambiae (3 to 4-day-old female) from laboratory Kisumu strain, and from field-collected individuals were confronted to combinations of stimuli comprising calf odour, human odour and outdoor air. In dual-choice tests, field mosquitoes chose human odour over calf odour, outdoor air over calf odour and responded equally to human and outdoor air, while laboratory mosquitoes responded equally to human and calf odour, human odour over outdoor air and calf odour over outdoor air. Overall, no effect of CO(2) exhaled by humans and calves neither on the proportion of activated mosquitoes nor on the relative attractiveness to odour stimuli was found. We report for the first time an intraspecific variation in host-odour responses. This study clearly suggests that there may be genetic polymorphism underlying host preference and emphasizes that the highly anthropophilic label given to An. gambiae s.s. must be carefully interpreted and refer to populations rather than the whole sibling species.},

@article{George2014,
	abstract = {Adult female mosquitoes need blood to develop their eggs and both sexes use nectar and honeydew as carbohydrate resources for flight, survival and to enhance reproduction. However, there are also a few reports in the literature of mosquitoes feeding on haemolymph of soft-bodied insects such as caterpillars. The frequency and significance of this entomophagous behavior is not well understood, but is thought to be a vestige of ancestral feeding behavior or an opportunistic behavior that has evolved over time. In our current paper we investigated the extent to which the malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is attracted to, and can successfully feed on, larvae of two common moth species, Manduca sexta and Heliothis subflexa. Using y-tube olfactometer assays we found that female An. stephensi readily flew upwind to and landed on the caterpillars of both moth species. The nature of the volatile cues used in host location remains unclear but respirometer studies suggest a possible role of CO2. Laboratory cage assays further showed that the female mosquitoes were able to actively feed on moth larvae and gain sufficient nutritional benefit to influence survival. The extent to which such an opportunistic behavior occurs in the field has yet to be explored but our results suggest that this haemolymph feeding behavior could play a role in malaria mosquito life history and could provide a novel mechanism for horizontal transmission of pathogens and other micro-organisms between hosts.},

	abstract = {We analyze the evolutionary consequences of host re- sistance (the ability to decrease the probability of being infected by parasites) for the evolution of parasite virulence (the deleterious effect of a parasite on its host). When only single infections occur, host resistance does not affect the evolution of parasite virulence. How- ever, when superinfections occur, resistance tends to decrease the evolutionarily stable (ES) level of parasite virulence. We first study a simple model in which the host does not coevolve with the parasite (i.e., the frequency of resistant hosts is independent of the parasite). We show that a higher proportion of resistant host decreases the ES level of parasite virulence. Higher levels of the efficiency of host resistance, however, do not always decrease the ES parasite virulence. The implications of these results for virulence management (evo- lutionary consequences of public health policies) are discussed. Sec- ond, we analyze the case where host resistance is allowed to coevolve with parasite virulence using the classical gene-for-gene (GFG)model of host-parasite interaction. It is shown that GFG coevolution leads to lower parasite virulence (in comparison with a fully susceptible host population). The model clarifies and relates the different com- ponents of the cost of parasitism: infectivity (ability to infect the host) and virulence (deleterious effect) in an evolutionary perspective.},

We introduce a model that accounts for four mechanisms: colonisation-competition-extinction ecological dynamics, evolutionary dynamics, local negative feedbacks and environmental averaging. Three qualitatively distinct dynamics are possible, one dominated by specialists, another dominated by generalists and an intermediate situation exhibiting taxon cycles. We discuss how metacommunity diversity, macro-ecological patterns and environmental patterning are linked to the three qualitative dynamics. The model provides classical shapes for morph-abundance distributions, or diversity-area relationships. Diversity can be high when specialists dominate or when taxon cycles happen. Finally, local negative feedbacks often yield fine-grain environments for taxon cycle dynamics and coarse-grain environments when generalists dominate.},

Thus, parasite survival to the oocyst stage increased when the parasite antagonist gene LRIM1 (leucine‐rich repeat immune protein 1) of the mosquito was silenced, but decreased when the C‐type lectin agonist gene CTL4 or CTLMA2 ( CTL mannose binding 2 ) was silenced. However, such effects were shown for infections of the human mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae with the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei .

@article{Norris1996,
	abstract = {Symbioses are often regarded as an important means for the creation of evolutionary novelty as well as a trigger for the abrupt appearance of higher taxa. The fossil record of foraminifer-algal symbiosis suggests that the appearance of this ecological association contributed to the radiation of Paleogene planktic foraminifera. Isotopic evidence shows that photosymbiosis evolved in synchrony with a major diversification of trochospiral planktic foraminifera about 3.5 m.y. after the end-Cretaceous extinction. In modern planktic foraminifera, photosymbiotic species tend to have more cosmopolitan distributions than asymbiotic foraminifera and a greater ability to withstand periods of nutrient stress. The simultaneous taxonomic radiation and acquisition of photosymbiosis are evidence that the ecological strategy permitted Paleocene foraminifera to expand their niche in pelagic environments by diversifying into low-nutrient surface waters.A comparison of the species longevities of Neogene and Paleogene symbiotic clades suggests that photosymbiosis does not regulate the characteristic rate of taxonomic turnover in clades after they appear. Species longevities are much shorter in Paleocene and Eocene photosymbiotic morphospecies than they are among photosymbiotic Neogene clades; apparently photosymbiosis does not exert a significant control over long-term evolutionary rates. In addition, the absence of a characteristic morphology associated with photosymbiosis in Cenozoic planktic foraminifera suggests that morphology, as with rate of evolutionary turnover, is linked to symbiosis only because of common inheritance instead of a functional relationship. Although the coincidence between the acquisition of photosymbiosis and generic diversification does suggest a linkage between this ecology and the appearance of foraminiferal higher taxa, there is little indication at the present that symbioses control long-term morphological or ecological patterns within these groups after their appearance. Photosymbiosis, and other evolutionary innovations, may be more a catalyst for the differentiation of major groups than a predictable governor on evolutionary rates.},

There are now numerous reviews of virulence evolution in the literature but it is nevertheless still difficult to find a comprehensive treatment of the theory and data on the subject that is easily accessible to non-specialists. Here we attempt to do so by distilling the vast theoretical literature on the topic into a set of relatively few robust predictions. We then provide a comprehensive assessment of the available empirical literature that tests these predictions. Our results show that there have been some notable successes in integrating theory and data but also that theory and empiricism in this field do not `speak' to each other very well. We offer a few suggestions for how the connection between the two might be improved.},

@article{Shapiro2018,
	abstract = {While theory suggests conditions under which mutualism may evolve from parasitism, few studies have observed this transition empirically. Previously, we evolved Escherichia coli and the filamentous bacteriophage M13 in 96-well microplates, an environment in which the ancestral phage increased the growth rate and yield of the ancestral bacteria. In the majority of populations, mutualism was maintained or even enhanced between phages and coevolving bacteria; however, these same phages evolved traits that harmed the ancestral E. coli genotype. Here, we set out to determine if mutualism could evolve from this new parasitic interaction. To do so, we chose six evolved phage populations from the original experiment and used them to establish new infections of the ancestral bacteria. After 20 passages, mutualism evolved in almost all replicates, with the remainder growing commensally. Many phage populations also evolved to benefit both their local, evolving bacteria and the ancestral bacteria, though these phages were less beneficial to their co-occurring hosts than phages that harm the ancestral bacteria. These results demonstrate the rapid recovery of mutualism from parasitism, and we discuss how our findings relate to the evolution of phages that enhance the virulence of bacterial pathogens.

	abstract = {Vector-borne pathogens may alter traits of their primary hosts in ways that influence the frequency and nature of interactions between hosts and vectors. Previous work has reported enhanced mosquito attraction to host organisms infected with malaria parasites but did not address the mechanisms underlying such effects. Here we document malaria-induced changes in the odor profiles of infected mice (relative to healthy individuals) over the course of infection, as well as effects on the attractiveness of infected hosts to mosquito vectors. We observed enhanced mosquito attraction to infected mice during a key period after the subsidence of acute malaria symptoms, but during which mice remained highly infectious. This attraction corresponded to an overall elevation in the volatile emissions of infected mice observed during this period. Furthermore, data analyses--using discriminant analysis of principal components and random forest approaches--revealed clear differences in the composition of the volatile blends of infected and healthy individuals. Experimental manipulation of individual compounds that exhibited altered emission levels during the period when differential vector attraction was observed also elicited enhanced mosquito attraction, indicating that compounds being influenced by malaria infection status also mediate vector host-seeking behavior. These findings provide important insights into the cues that mediate vector attraction to hosts infected with transmissible stages of malaria parasites, as well as documenting characteristic changes in the odors of infected individuals that may have potential value as diagnostic biomarkers of infection.},

	abstract = {While for pathogen clones singly occupying a host it may pay to adopt a relatively avirulent host exploitation strategy, clones sharing a host have a conflict of interest that favors more virulent strategies. As the number of infections per host depends on the force of infection and the force of infection, in turn, depends on prevailing virulence, evolutionary analysis needs to be integrated with population dynamics. A full-fledged approach requires exceedingly large capacities for bookkeeping of the infection events and is therefore difficult to establish. In this article the host-pathogen interaction is studied for the simple case in which hosts may become at most doubly infected. It appears that evolution and population dynamics give rise to a feedback mechanism. When double infections are frequent, increased virulence is favored; but when pathogens become more virulent, the force of infection will decrease, favoring lower virulence again. Thus, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) virulence depends on the interaction within hosts as well as on the interaction at the population level. As current models of host- microparasite interactions take only first infections into account, they may be inappropriate for evolutionary analyses, which would require modeling of within-host competition between strains and thus of multiple infections},

	abstract = {Evolutionary transitions from parasitism towards beneficial or mutualistic associations may encompass a change from horizontal transmission to (strict) vertical transmission. Parasites with both vertical and horizontal transmission are amendable to study factors driving such transitions. In a long-term experiment, microcosm populations of the protozoan Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata were exposed to three growth treatments, manipulating vertical transmission opportunities over ca. 800 host generations. In inoculation tests, horizontal transmission propagules produced by parasites from a 'high-growth' treatment, with elevated host division rates increasing levels of parasite vertical transmission, showed a near-complete loss of infectivity. A similar reduction was observed for parasites from a treatment alternating between high growth and low growth (i.e., low levels of population turn-over). Parasites from a low-growth treatment had the highest infectivity on all host genotypes tested. Our results complement previous findings of reduced investment in horizontal transmission and increased vertical transmissibility of high-growth parasites. We explain the loss of horizontal transmissibility by epidemiological feedbacks and resistance evolution, reducing the frequency of susceptible hosts in the population and thereby decreasing the selective advantage of horizontal transmission. This illustrates how environmental conditions may push parasites with a mixed transmission mode towards becoming vertically transmitted non-virulent symbionts. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {In parasites with mixed modes of transmission, ecological conditions may determine the relative importance of vertical and horizontal transmission for parasite fitness. This may lead to differential selection pressure on the efficiency of the two modes of transmission and on parasite virulence. In populations with high birth rates, increased opportunities for vertical transmission may select for higher vertical transmissibility and possibly lower virulence. We tested this idea in experimental populations of the protozoan Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Serial dilution produced constant host population growth and frequent vertical transmission. Consistent with predictions, evolved parasites from this "high-growth" treatment had higher fidelity of vertical transmission and lower virulence than parasites from host populations constantly kept near their carrying capacity ("low-growth treatment"). High-growth parasites also produced fewer, but more infectious horizontal transmission stages, suggesting the compensation of trade-offs between vertical and horizontal transmission components in this treatment. These results illustrate how environmentally driven changes in host demography can promote evolutionary divergence of parasite life history and transmission strategies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).

	abstract = {We set out to explore a class of stochastic processes, called "adaptive dynamics", which supposedly capture some of the essentials of the long-term biological evolution. These processes have a strong deterministic component. This allows a classification of their qualitative features which in many aspects is similar to classifications from the theory of deterministic dynamical systems. But they also display a good number of clear-cut novel dynamical phenomena. The sample functions of an adaptive dynamics are piece-wise constant function from R{\_}+ to the finite subsets of some "trait" space X in R{\^{}}k. Those subsets we call "adaptive conditions". Both the range and the jumps of a sample function are governed by a function s, called "fitness", mapping the present adaptive condition and the trait value of a potential "mutant" to R. Sign(s) tell us which subsets of X qualify as adaptive conditions, which mutants can potentially "invade", leading to a jump in the sample function, and which adaptive condition(s) can result from such invasion. Fitness supposedly satisfy certain constraints derived from their population/community dynamical origin, such as the fact that all mutants which are equal to some "residents", i.e., element of the present adaptive condition, have zero fitness. Apart from that, we suppose that s is as smooth as can be possibly condoned by its community dynamical origin. Moreover, we assume that a mutant can differ but little from its resident "progenitor". In sections 1 and 2 we describe the biological background of our mathematical framework. In section 1 we deal with the position of our framework relative to present and past evolutionary research. In section 2 we discuss the community dynamical origin of s, and the reasons for making a number of specific simplifications relative to the full complexity seen in nature. In sections 3 and 4 we consider some general, mathematical as well as biological, conclusions that can be drawn from our framework in its simplest guise, that is, when we assume that X is 1-dimensional, and that the cardinality of the adaptive conditions stays low. The main result is a classification of the adaptively singular points. These points comprise both the adaptive point attractors, as well as the points where the adaptive trajectory can branch, thus attaining its characteristic tree-like shape. In section 5 we discuss how adaptive dynamics relate through a limiting argument to stochastic models in which individual organisms are represented as separate entities. It is only through such a limiting procedure that any class of population or evolutionary models can eventually be justified. Our basic assumptions are (i) clonal reproduction, i.e., the resident individuals reproduce faithfully without any of the complications of sex or Mendelian genetics, except for the occasional occurrence of a mutant, (ii) a large system size and an even rarer occurrence of mutations per birth event, (iii) uniqueness and global attractiveness of any interior attractor of the community dynamics in the limit of the infinite system size. In section 6 we try to delineate, by a tentative listing of "axioms", the largest possible class of processes that can result from the kind of limiting considerations spelled out in section 5. And in section 7 we heuristically derive some very general predictions about macro-evolutionary patterns, based on those weak assumptions only. In the final section 8 we discuss (i) how the results from the preceding sections may fit into a more encompassing view of biological evolution, and (ii) some directions for further research.},

@article{Lefevre2013,
	abstract = {Understanding how mosquito vectors and malaria parasites interact is of fundamental interest, and it also offers novel perspectives for disease control. Both the genetic and environmental contexts are known to affect the ability of mosquitoes to support malaria development and transmission, i.e., vector competence. Although the role of environment has long been recognized, much work has focused on host and parasite genetic effects. However, the last few years have seen a surge of studies revealing a great diversity of ways in which non-genetic factors can interfere with mosquito-Plasmodium interactions. Here, we review the current evidence for such environmentally mediated effects, including ambient temperature, mosquito diet, microbial gut flora, and infection history, and we identify additional factors previously overlooked in mosquito-Plasmodium interactions. We also discuss epidemiological implications, and the evolutionary consequences for vector immunity and parasite transmission strategies. Finally, we propose directions for further research and argue that an improved knowledge of non-genetic influences on mosquito-Plasmodium interactions could aid in implementing conventional malaria control measures and contribute to the design of novel strategies.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed a large diversity of Plasmodium spp. among African great apes. Some of these species are related to Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent agent of human malaria (subgenus Laverania), and others to Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium vivax (subgenus Plasmodium), three other human malaria agents. Laverania parasites exhibit strict host specificity in their natural environment. Plasmodium reichenowi, Plasmodium billcollinsi, Plasmodium billbrayi and Plasmodium gaboni infect only chimpanzees, while Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium blacklocki and Plasmodium adleri are restricted to gorillas and Plasmodium falciparum is pandemic in humans. This host specificity may be due to genetic and/or environmental factors. Infrastructures hosting captive primates, such as sanctuaries and health centres, usually concentrate different primate species, thus favouring pathogen exchanges. Using molecular tools, we analysed blood samples from captive non-human primates living in Gabon to evaluate the risk of Plasmodium spp. transfers between host species. We also included blood samples from workers taking care of primates to assess whether primate-human parasite transfers occurred. We detected four transfers of Plasmodium from gorillas towards chimpanzees, one from chimpanzees to gorillas, three from humans towards chimpanzees and one from humans to mandrills. No simian Plasmodium was found in the blood samples from humans working with primates. These findings demonstrate that the genetic barrier that determines the apparent host specificity of Laverania is not completely impermeable and that parasite exchanges between gorillas and chimpanzees are possible in confined environments.},

@article{Cator2013,
	abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that Plasmodium parasites can manipulate mosquito feeding behaviours such as probing, persistence and engorgement rate in order to enhance transmission success. Here, we broaden analysis of this 'manipulation phenotype' to consider proximate foraging behaviours, including responsiveness to host odours and host location. Using Anopheles stephensi and Plasmodium yoelii as a model system, we demonstrate that mosquitoes with early stage infections (i.e. non-infectious oocysts) exhibit reduced attraction to a human host, whereas those with late-stage infections (i.e. infectious sporozoites) exhibit increased attraction. These stage-specific changes in behaviour were paralleled by changes in the responsiveness of mosquito odourant receptors, providing a possible neurophysiological mechanism for the responses. However, we also found that both the behavioural and neurophysiological changes could be generated by immune challenge with heat-killed Escherichia coli and were thus not tied explicitly to the presence of malaria parasites. Our results support the hypothesis that the feeding behaviour of female mosquitoes is altered by Plasmodium, but question the extent to which this is owing to active manipulation by malaria parasites of host behaviour.},

In addition, termites rely on the biosynthetic capacities of their gut microbiota as a nutritional resource. The mineralization of humus components in the guts of soil-feeding species also contributes to nitrogen cycling in tropical soils.

	abstract = {The gram-negative bacterial species Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli are members of the family Enterobacteriaceae that spend a good part of their lives as residents of animal hosts. S. enterica is the etiologic agent of gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in humans (88), whereas E. coli is most com- monly known as a commensal of the lower intestine of mam- mals, although pathogenic variants also exist (77). The animal host is believed to be the primary habitat of these two enteric species (86), which are genetically endowed to do well in this environment. For example, Salmonella has genes that mediate invasion of and survival within host cells, including genes that promote resistance to different microbicidal host products (62, 88). Likewise, the E. coli genome encodes proteins that medi- ate resistance to acid pH as well as growth on lactose, which is critical for a commensal of mammals (11, 57). In this review, we discuss whether Salmonella and E. coli live in stable, dividing populations in nonhost environments and whether such environments constitute dead ends for these species (e.g., as a consequence of residing in the vertebrate lower intestine, whose contents are regularly excreted [86, 102]). In addition, we examine the role that genes specific to Salmonella and E. coli play in the different abilities of these species to proliferate outside animal hosts. DO},

The research presented here uses TEM and PI staining to analyse the morphology of the intestine of H. gingivalis. Specimens cultured under different conditions were included to determine if differences in ultrastructure are induced by culturing method. TEM analysis revealed that the intestinal tract comprises a single layer of cells in which nine pairs of nuclei can be distinguished. Further, unusual dichotomously and trichotomously branched microvilli were observed next to finger-like cylindrical microvilli, the latter being the most commonly described form in nematodes. Finally, three different types of secretion vesicles, i.e., spherical (type I), thread-like (type II) and enlarged globular (type III), occurred independently from each other along the intestinal tract. The relationship of morphological adaptations of the microvilli to parasitism in nematodes is discussed.},

	abstract = {Transmission of malaria is dependent on the successful completion of the Plasmodium lifecycle in the Anopheles vector. Major obstacles are encountered in the midgut tissue, where most parasites are killed by the mosquito's immune system. In the present study, DNA microarray analyses have been used to compare Anopheles gambiae responses to invasion of the midgut epithelium by the ookinete stage of the human pathogen Plasmodium falciparum and the rodent experimental model pathogen P. berghei. Invasion by P. berghei had a more profound impact on the mosquito transcriptome, including a variety of functional gene classes, while P. falciparum elicited a broader immune response at the gene transcript level. Ingestion of human malaria-infected blood lacking invasive ookinetes also induced a variety of immune genes, including several anti-Plasmodium factors. Twelve selected genes were assessed for effect on infection with both parasite species and bacteria using RNAi gene silencing assays, and seven of these genes were found to influence mosquito resistance to both parasite species. An MD2-like receptor, AgMDL1, and an immunolectin, FBN39, showed specificity in regulating only resistance to P. falciparum, while the antimicrobial peptide gambicin and a novel putative short secreted peptide, IRSP5, were more specific for defense against the rodent parasite P. berghei. While all the genes that affected Plasmodium development also influenced mosquito resistance to bacterial infection, four of the antimicrobial genes had no effect on Plasmodium development. Our study shows that the impact of P. falciparum and P. berghei infection on A. gambiae biology at the gene transcript level is quite diverse, and the defense against the two Plasmodium species is mediated by antimicrobial factors with both universal and Plasmodium-species specific activities. Furthermore, our data indicate that the mosquito is capable of sensing infected blood constituents in the absence of invading ookinetes, thereby inducing anti-Plasmodium immune responses.},

	abstract = {Starting in 2006, surprisingly tiny genomes have been discovered from numerous bacterial symbionts of insect hosts. Despite their size, each retains some genes that enable provisioning of limiting nutrients or other capabilities required by hosts. Genome sequence analyses show that genome reduction is an ongoing process, resulting in a continuum of sizes, with the smallest genome currently known at 112 kilobases. Genome reduction is typical in host-restricted symbionts and pathogens, but the tiniest genomes are restricted to symbionts required by hosts and restricted to specialized host cells, resulting from long coevolution with hosts. Genes are lost in all functional categories, but core genes for central informational processes, including genes encoding ribosomal proteins, are mostly retained, whereas genes underlying production of cell envelope components are especially depleted. Thus, these entities retain cell-like properties but are heavily dependent on coadaptation of hosts, which continuously evolve to support the symbionts upon which they depend.

	abstract = {Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are vectors for trypanosome parasites, the agents of the deadly sleeping sickness disease in Africa. Tsetse also harbor two maternally transmitted enteric mutualist endosymbionts: the primary intracellular obligate Wigglesworthia glossinidia and the secondary commensal Sodalis glossinidius. Both endosymbionts are transmitted to the intrauterine progeny through the milk gland secretions of the viviparous female. We administered various antibiotics either continuously by per os supplementation of the host blood meal diet or discretely by hemocoelic injections into fertile females in an effort to selectively eliminate the symbionts to study their individual functions. A symbiont-specific PCR amplification assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis were used to evaluate symbiont infection outcomes. Tetracycline and rifampin treatments eliminated all tsetse symbionts but reduced the fecundity of the treated females. Ampicillin treatments did not affect the intracellular Wigglesworthia localized in the bacteriome organ and retained female fecundity. The resulting progeny of ampicillin-treated females, however, lacked Wigglesworthia but still harbored the commensal Sodalis. Our results confirm the presence of two physiologically distinct Wigglesworthia populations: the bacteriome-localized Wigglesworthia involved with nutritional symbiosis and free-living Wigglesworthia in the milk gland organ responsible for maternal transmission to the progeny. We evaluated the reproductive fitness, longevity, digestion, and vectorial competence of flies that were devoid of Wigglesworthia. The absence of Wigglesworthia completely abolished the fertility of females but not that of males. Both the male and female Wigglesworthia-free adult progeny displayed longevity costs and were significantly compromised in their blood meal digestion ability. Finally, while the vectorial competence of the young newly hatched adults without Wigglesworthia was comparable to that of their wild-type counterparts, older flies displayed higher susceptibility to trypanosome infections, indicating a role for the mutualistic symbiosis in host immunobiology. The ability to rear adult tsetse that lack the obligate Wigglesworthia endosymbionts will now enable functional investigations into this ancient symbiosis.},

While biologists point singularly to what they see as his heroic achievement, its neglect and subsequent rediscovery, we introduce a broader and much more complex perspective on his science, his troubled life and career. We present a view of Merezhkowsky as zoologist, anthropologist, botanist, philosopher, and novelist. We explain the genesis of his theory of the origin of chloroplasts and of nucleus and cytoplasm as symbionts, as well as his depiction of the geo-chemical context of the origins and early evolution of life on earth. We also disclose his sordid social and political activities, his eugenics and racist writings, his paedophilia, and his metaphysics. Finally, we describe the context of his elaborate suicide in 1921.},

	abstract = {For over 100 years, endosymbiotic theories have figured in thoughts about the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. More than 20 different versions of endosymbiotic theory have been presented in the literature to explain the origin of eukaryotes and their mitochondria. Very few of those models account for eukaryotic anaerobes. The role of energy and the energetic constraints that prokaryotic cell organization placed on evolutionary innovation in cell history has recently come to bear on endosymbiotic theory. Only cells that possessed mitochondria had the bioenergetic means to attain eukaryotic cell complexity, which is why there are no true intermediates in the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Current versions of endosymbiotic theory have it that the host was an archaeon (an archaebacterium), not a eukaryote. Hence the evolutionary history and biology of archaea increasingly comes to bear on eukaryotic origins, more than ever before. Here, we have compiled a survey of endosymbiotic theories for the origin of eukaryotes and mitochondria, and for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus, summarizing the essentials of each and contrasting some of their predictions to the observations. A new aspect of endosymbiosis in eukaryote evolution comes into focus from these considerations: the host for the origin of plastids was a facultative anaerobe.},

@article{Ferris2018a,
	abstract = {Given rapidly changing environments, it is important for us to understand how the evolution of host defence responds to fluctuating environments. Here we present the first theoretical study of evolution of host resistance to parasitism in a classic epidemiological model where the host birth rate varies seasonally. We show that this form of seasonality has clear qualitative and quantitative impacts on the evolution of resistance. When the host can recover from infection, it evolves a lower level of defence when the amplitude is high. However, when recovery is absent, the host increases its defence for higher amplitudes. Between these different behaviours we find a region of parameter space that allows evolutionary bistability. When this occurs, the level of defence the host evolves depends on initial conditions, and in some cases a switch between attractors can lead to different periods in the population dynamics at each of the evolutionary stable strategies. Crucially, we find that evolutionary behaviour found in a constant environment for this model doesn't always hold for hosts with highly variable birth rates. Hence we argue that seasonality must be taken into account if we want to make predictions about evolutionary trends in real-world host-parasite systems.},

@article{Martinic2011,
	abstract = {Shigella flexneri is endemic in most underdeveloped countries, causing diarrheal disease and dysentery among young children. In order to reach its target site, the colon, Shigella must overcome the acid environment of the stomach. Shigella is able to persist in this stressful environment and, because of this ability it can initiate infection following the ingestion of very small inocula. Thus, acid resistance is considered an important virulence trait of this bacterium. It has been reported that moderate acid conditions regulate the expression of numerous components of the bacterial envelope. Because the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the bacterial surface, here we have addressed the role of LPS in acid resistance of S. flexneri 2a. Defined deletion mutants in genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis, assembly and length regulation of the LPS O antigen were constructed and assayed for resistance to pH 2.5 after adaptation to pH 5.5. The results showed that a mutant lacking O antigen was significantly more sensitive to extreme acid conditions than the wild type. Not only the presence of polymerized O antigen, but also a particular polymer length (S-OAg) was required for acid resistance. Glucosylation of the O antigen also contributed to this property. In addition, a moderate acidic pH induced changes in the composition of the lipid A domain of LPS. The main modification was the addition of phosphoethanolamine to the 1' phosphate of lipid A. This modification increased resistance of S. flexneri to extreme acid conditions, provide that O antigen was produced. Overall, the results of this work point out to an important role of LPS in resistance of Shigella flexneri to acid stress.},

@article{Choisy2010,
	abstract = {Mixed-genotype parasite infections are common in nature. Theoretical studies analyze the effects of such infections over evolutionary time and predict an increase in virulence due to the competitive advantage of virulent parasites. In contrast, experimental studies compare the overall virulence of mixed and single infections within one generation. Although these within-generation comparisons have limited relevance to existing theory, they demonstrate that within-host parasite interactions are not restricted to competition for resources, as envisaged by theory. Instead, mixed infections may result in phenotypic changes in growth rate or impaired immune clearance. Developing and using a two-parasite epidemiological model with recovery, we confirm that within-host competition for resources selects for higher virulence. However, parasite phenotypic plasticity and impaired host immunity can select for lower virulence. Because these latter two mechanisms would be detected by experimentalists as an increase in pathology, our results warn against the temptation to draw inferences on virulence evolution on the basis of single-generation experiments.},

Although many studies of multiple infections have focused on disease outcomes (e.g. virulence), rather than on the particular parasite strategies that have adapted in response to the ensuing competitive interactions, these strategies are ultimately responsible for shaping disease outcomes of interest.

	abstract = {The evaluation of transmission reducing interventions (TRI) to control malaria widely uses membrane feeding assays. In such assays, the intensity of Plasmodium infection in the vector might affect the measured efficacy of the candidates to block transmission. Gametocyte density in the host blood is a determinant of the infection success in the mosquito, however, uncertain estimates of parasite densities and intrinsic characteristics of the infected blood can induce variability. To reduce this variation, a feasible method is to dilute infectious blood samples. We describe the effect of diluting samples of Plasmodium-containing blood samples to allow accurate relative measures of gametocyte densities and their impact on mosquito infectivity and TRI efficacy. Natural Plasmodium falciparum samples were diluted to generate a wide range of parasite densities, and fed to Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. This was compared with parallel dilutions conducted on Plasmodium berghei infections. We examined how blood dilution influences the observed blocking activity of anti-Pbs28 monoclonal antibody using the P.berghei/Anopheles stephensi system.In the natural species combination P.. falciparum/An.. coluzzii, blood dilution using heat-inactivated, infected blood as diluents, revealed positive near linear relationships, between gametocyte densities and oocyst loads in the range tested. A similar relationship was observed in the P.berghei/An.. stephensi system when using a similar dilution method. In contrast, diluting infected mice blood with fresh uninfected blood dramatically increases the infectiousness. This suggests that highly infected mice blood contains inhibitory factors or reduced blood moieties, which impede infection and may in turn, lead to misinterpretation when comparing individual TRI evaluation assays. In the lab system, the transmission blocking activity of an antibody specific for Pbs28 was confirmed to be density-dependent. This highlights the need to carefully interpret evaluations of TRI candidates, regarding gametocyte densities in the P.berghei/An. stephensi system.},

	abstract = {This article uses mathematical models to investigate the consequences of noninstantaneous choice between two prey types by a predator. The models are characterized by three features: sustained cycles in predator and prey population sizes, a trade-off between the predator's consumption rates of the two prey and adaptive adjustment of the consumption rates at a rate proportional to the change in predator fitness per unit change in consumption rates. Adaptive adjustment of consumption rates frequently prevents the system from achieving an ideal free distribution of predator foraging effort and frequently results in chaotic dynamics or alternative attractors. The process of switching to consume the more common prey can reduce the minimum density of one or both prey. These phenomena occur for a variety of different models, including models in which both prey are in the same or in distinct habitats. An ideal free distribution can often be attained by adding prey refuges or immigration, provided these have a large enough effect on the dynamics of the system. The dynamics of switching can be important in determining indirect interactions between prey species and other aspects of food web dynamics.},

	abstract = {Many mutualisms involve reciprocal exploitation, such that each species in a mutualism is a consumer of a resource provided by the other. Frequently, such mutualisms are reformed each generation, and where they involve close physiological contact, such as between mycorrhizal fungi and plants, they can be considered as examples of reciprocal parasitism. Here we place such interactions in the framework of the Prisoner's Dilemma, and examine the conditions for the spread of mutualism using a population genetics model analogous to that used for understanding the genetic and numerical dynamics of host-parasite interactions. Genetic variants within each of two species determine whether the interaction is mutualistic or selfish, the latter being represented by resistance to being exploited or parasitized. We assume that there are fitness costs to resistance which are present even in the absence of the interaction. Just as in host-parasite interactions, we examine the effect of assuming that encounter rates between potential mutualists (and therefore entry into the Prisoner's Dilemma `game') depend on the density and frequency of the different types interacting individuals. These elements of ecological realism greatly facilitate the evolution of mutualism even in the absence of spatial structure or iterative encounters. Moreover, stable genetic polymorphisms for resistant (selfish) and susceptible (mutualistic) alleles can be maintained, something that is not possible with the classical Prisoner's Dilemma formulation. The sensitivity of the outcomes to levels of density-dependence and mortality rate suggests environmental as well as genetic processes are likely to be important in determining directions in this pathway to mutualism.},

@article{Gouagna2004,
	abstract = {Summary Quantitatively assessing the impact of naturally occurring transmission-blocking (TB) immunity on malaria parasite sporogonic development may provide a useful interpretation of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we compare the effects of plasma derived from 23 naturally infected gametocyte carriers (OWN) with plasma from donors without previous malaria exposure (AB) on the early sporogonic development of Plasmodium falciparum in Anopheles gambiae. Reduced parasite development efficiency was associated with mosquitoes taking a blood meal mixed with the gametocyte carriers' own plasma, whereas replacing autologous plasma with non-immune resulted in the highest level of parasite survival. Seven days after an infective blood meal, 39.1{\%} of the gametocyte carriers' plasma tested showed TB activity as only a few macrogametocytes ingested along with immune plasma ended up as ookinetes but subsequent development was blocked in the presence of immune plasma. In other experiments (60.9{\%}), the effective number of parasites declined dramatically from one developmental stage to the next, and resulted in an infection rate that was two-fold lower in OWN than in AB infection group. These findings are in agreement with those in other reports and go further by quantitatively examining at which transition stages TB immunity exerts its action. The transitions from macrogametocytes to gamete/zygote and from gamete/zygote to ookinete were identified as main targets. However, the net contribution of host plasma factors to these interstage parasite reductions was low (5-20{\%}), suggesting that irrespective of the host plasma factors, mosquito factors might also lower the survival level of parasites during the early sporogonic development.},

	abstract = {Climate fluctuations and human exploitation are causing global changes in nutrient enrichment of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and declining abundances of apex predators. The resulting tro-phic cascades have had profound effects on food webs, leading to significant economic and socie-tal consequences. However, the strength of cascades--that is the extent to which a disturbance is diminished as it propagates through a food web--varies widely between ecosystems, and there is no formal theory as to why this should be so. Some food chain models reproduce cascade effects seen in nature, but to what extent is this dependent on their formulation? We show that inclusion of processes represented mathematically as density-dependent regulation of either consumer uptake or mortality rates is necessary for the generation of realistic 'top-down' cascades in simple food chain models. Realistically modelled 'bottom-up' cascades, caused by changing nutrient input, are also dependent on the inclusion of density dependence, but especially on mortality regu-lation as a caricature of, e.g. disease and parasite dynamics or intraguild predation. We show that our conclusions, based on simple food chains, transfer to a more complex marine food web model in which cascades are induced by varying river nutrient inputs or fish harvesting rates.},

	abstract = {Endosymbiotic theory goes back over 100 years. It explains the similarity of chloroplasts and mitochondria to free-living prokaryotes by suggesting that the organelles arose from prokaryotes through (endo)symbiosis. Gene trees provide important evidence in favour of symbiotic theory at a coarse-grained level, but the finer we get into the details of branches in trees containing dozens or hundreds of taxa, the more equivocal evidence for endosymbiotic events sometimes becomes. It seems that either the interpretation of some endosymbiotic events are wrong, or something is wrong with the interpretations of some gene trees having many leaves. There is a need for evidence that is independent of gene trees and that can help outline the course of symbiosis in eukaryote evolution. Protein import is the strongest evidence we have for the single origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria. It is probably also the strongest evidence we have to sort out the number and nature of secondary endosymbiotic events that have occurred in evolution involving the red plastid lineage. If we relax our interpretation of individual gene trees, endosymbiotic theory can tell us a lot.},

	abstract = {Parasites are thought to play an important role in sexual selection and the evolution of mating strategies, which in turn are likely to be critical to the transmission and therefore the evolution of parasites. Despite this clear interdependence we have little understanding of parasite-mediated sexual selection in the context of reciprocal parasite evolution. Here we develop a general coevolutionary model between host mate preference and the virulence of a sexually transmitted parasite. We show when the characteristics of both the host and parasite lead to coevolutionarily stable strategies or runaway selection, and when coevolutionary cycling between high and low levels of host mate choosiness and virulence is possible. A prominent argument against parasites being involved in sexual selection is that they should evolve to become less virulent when transmission depends on host mating success. The present study, however, demonstrates that coevolution can maintain stable host mate choosiness and parasite virulence or indeed coevolutionary cycling of both traits. We predict that choosiness should vary inversely with parasite virulence and that both relatively long and short life spans select against choosy behavior in the host. The model also reveals that hosts can evolve different behavioral responses from the same initial conditions, which highlights difficulties in using comparative analysis to detect parasitemediated sexual selection. Taken as a whole, our results emphasize the importance of viewing parasite-mediated sexual selection in the context of coevolution.},

Plasmodium falciparum infects Anopheles gambiae efficiently at low densities (4{\%} mosquitoes at 1/µl blood), although substantially more ({\textgreater}200/µl) are required to increase infection further. In a site in Burkina Faso, children harbour more gametocytes than adults though the non-linear relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection means that (per person) they only contribute slightly more to transmission. This method can be used to determine the reservoir of infection in different endemic settings. Interventions reducing gametocyte density need to be highly effective in order to halt human-mosquito transmission, although their use can be optimised by targeting those contributing the most to transmission.

	abstract = {Background: The larvae of the eye fluke, Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, emerge into the water from a snail and then infect a fish. Once in a fish, they travel to its eye lenses. The parasite infects its definitive host, a fish-eating bird, if the fish is eaten by the bird. Parasitized fish behave in ways that make them more susceptible to bird predation. Previous studies have suggested that this host manipulation is 'specific'. as parasites do not increase the susceptibility of fish to non-host predators such as piscivorous fish. This suggests that eye flukes evolved to manipulate host fish as a strategy to enhance transmission. Question: Do eye flukes change the behavioural traits of fish important in determining their vulnerability to non-host fish predators? Hypotheses: Given the evidence of specific host manipulation in this system, the parasites (1) should not alter such traits. or (2) alterations in them should have opposite effects in determining the susceptibility of fish to piscine predation. Organisms: The trematode parasite, D. pseudospathaceum, and its rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, intermediate host. Methods: A laboratory experiment to determine the effect of eye flukes on behavioural traits of fish that are part of their general anti-predatory tactics or specifically determine their susceptibility to piscine predation. We measured the following traits: activity, use of shelter, and escape response to underwater predator attacks. Results: Parasites did not affect any of the behavioural traits examined. Conclusion: Diplostomum pseudospathaceum manipulates only traits that specifically predispose fish to bird predators, not the traits important in determining their susceptibility to non-hosts},

Although the symbiosis is well described, little is known about the locations of 'E. sertula' or the bryostatins throughout larval settlement, metamorphosis and early development. In this study, we simultaneously localized 'E. sertula' and the bryostatins in multiple stages of the B. neritina life cycle, using a novel bryostatin detection method based on its known ability to bind mammalian protein kinase C. Our results suggest that the bryostatins are deposited onto the exterior of B. neritina larvae during embryonic development, persist on the larval surface throughout metamorphosis and are shed prior to cuticle formation. During metamorphosis, 'E. sertula' remains adhered to the larval pallial epithelium and is incorporated into the preancestrula cystid tissue layer, which ultimately develops into a bud and gives rise to the next zooid in the colony. Colocalization of bryostatin signal with aggregates of 'E. sertula' in buds of ancestrulae suggested new synthesis of bryostatins in ancestrulae. In adult B. neritina colonies, symbiont microcolonies were observed in the funicular cords of rhizoids, which likely result in asexual transmission of 'E. sertula' to regenerated colonies. Furthermore, bryostatin signal was detected on the surface of the rhizoids of adult B. neritina colonies. Through simultaneous localization of the bryostatins and the 'E. sertula,' we determined how 'E. sertula' is transmitted, and identified shifts in bryostatin localization throughout the life cycle of the host B. neritina.},

A major challenge of this theoretical work has been to un-ravel the tangled feedback loop between ecology and evolution. This has prompted the development of two main classes of models. While quantitative genetics models jointly consider the ecological and evo-lutionary dynamics of a focal population, a separation of timescales between ecology and evolution is assumed by evolutionary game the-ory, adaptive dynamics, and inclusive fitness theory. As a result, the-oretical evolutionary ecology tends to be divided among different schools of thought, with different toolboxes and motivations. My aim in this synthesis is to highlight the connections between these different approaches and clarify the current state of theory in evo-lutionary ecology. Central to this approach is to make explicit the dependence on environmental dynamics of the population and evo-lutionary dynamics, thereby materializing the eco-evolutionary feed-back loop. This perspective sheds light on the interplay between environmental feedback and the timescales of ecological and evolu-tionary processes. I conclude by discussing some potential exten-sions and challenges to our current theoretical understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

	abstract = {Parasites with complex life cycles, relying on trophic transmission to a definitive host, very often induce changes in the behaviour or appearance of their intermediate hosts. Because this usually makes the intermediate host vulnerable to predation by the definitive host, it is generally assumed that the parasite's transmission rate is increased, and that the modification of the host is, therefore, of great adaptive significance to the parasite. However, in the ecological "real world" other predators unsuitable as hosts may just as well take advantage of the facilitation process and significantly erode the benefit of host manipulation. Here we show that the intertidal New Zealand cockle (Austrovenus stutchburyi), manipulated by its echinostome trematode (Curtuteria australis) to rest on the sediment surface fully exposed to predation from the avian definitive host, is also subject to sublethal predation from a benthic feeding fish (Notolabrus celidotus, Labridae). The fish is targeting only the cockle-foot, in which the parasite preferentially encysts, reducing the infection intensity of manipulated cockles to levels comparable with those in non-manipulated, buried cockles. Based on the frequency and intensity of the foot cropping and predation rates on surfaced cockles by avian hosts, it is estimated that 2.5{\%} of the parasite population in manipulated cockles is transmitted successfully whereas 17.1{\%} is lost to fish. We argue that the adaptive significance of manipulation in the present system depends critically on the feeding behaviour of the definitive host. If cockles constitute the majority of prey items, there will be selection against manipulation. If manipulated cockles are taken as an easily accessible supplement to a diet composed mostly of other prey organisms, behavioural manipulation of the cockle host appears a high risk, high profit transmission strategy. Both these feeding behaviours of birds are known to occur in the field. ?? 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Generalist bacterial pathogens, with the ability for environmental survival and growth, often face variable conditions during their outside-host period. Abiotic factors (such as nutrient deprivation) act as selection pressures for bacterial characteristics, but their effect on virulence is not entirely understood. "Sit and wait" hypothesis expects that long outside-host survival selects for increased virulence, but maintaining virulence in the absence of hosts is generally expected to be costly if active investments are needed. We analysed how long term starvation influences bacterial population structure and virulence of an environmentally transmitting fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: F. columnare populations in distilled water and in lake water were monitored for 5 months. During the experiment, the population structure of F. columnare diversified by rough and soft colony morphotypes appearing among the ancestral rhizoid ones. After 5 months starvation in lake water, the virulence of the starved and ancestral bacterial isolates was tested. The starved rhizoid isolates had significantly higher virulence than the ancestral rhizoid, whereas the virulence of the rough isolates was low.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We suggest that F. columnare population diversification is an adaptation to tolerate unpredictable environment, but may also have other biological significance. Maintaining and increasing virulence ensures efficient invasion into the host especially under circumstances when the host density is low or the outside-host period is long. Changing from rhizoid into a rough morphotype has trade-offs in making bacteria less virulent and unable to exploit the host, but may ensure bacterial survival under unpredictable conditions. Our study gives an example how abiotic selection can diversify virulence of environmentally transmitting bacterial pathogen.},

	abstract = {Insects with restricted diets rely on obligate microbes to fulfil nutritional requirements essential for biological function. Tsetse flies, vectors of African trypanosome parasites, feed exclusively on vertebrate blood and harbour the obligate endosymbiont Wigglesworthia glossinidia. Without Wigglesworthia, tsetse are unable to reproduce. These symbionts are sheltered within specialized cells (bacteriocytes) that form the midgut-associated bacteriome organ. To decipher the core functions of this symbiosis essential for tsetse's survival, we performed dual-RNA-seq analysis of the bacteriome, coupled with metabolomic analysis of bacteriome and haemolymph collected from normal and symbiont-cured (sterile) females. Bacteriocytes produce immune regulatory peptidoglycan recognition protein (pgrp-lb) that protects Wigglesworthia, and a multivitamin transporter (smvt) that can aid in nutrient dissemination. Wigglesworthia overexpress a molecular chaperone (GroEL) to augment their translational/transport machinery and biosynthesize an abundance of B vitamins (specifically B1-, B2-, B3- and B6-associated metabolites) to supplement the host's nutritionally deficient diet. The absence of Wigglesworthia's contributions disrupts multiple metabolic pathways impacting carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. These disruptions affect the dependent downstream processes of nucleotide biosynthesis and metabolism and biosynthesis of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), an essential cofactor. This holistic fundamental knowledge of the symbiotic dialogue highlights new biological targets for the development of innovative vector control methods.},

	abstract = {Symbiosis is a major source of evolutionary innovation and, by allowing species to exploit new ecological niches, underpins the functioning of ecosystems. The transition from free-living to obligate symbiosis requires the alignment of the partners' fitness interests and the evolution of mutual dependence. While symbiotic taxa are known to vary widely in the extent of host-symbiont dependence, rather less is known about variation within symbiotic associations. Using experiments with the microbial symbiosis between the protist Paramecium bursaria and the alga Chlorella, we show variation between pairings in host-symbiont dependence, encompassing facultative associations, mutual dependence and host dependence upon the symbiont. Facultative associations, that is where both the host and the symbiont were capable of free-living growth, displayed higher symbiotic growth rates and higher per host symbiont loads than those with greater degrees of dependence. These data show that the Paramecium-Chlorella interaction exists at the boundary between facultative and obligate symbiosis, and further suggest that the host is more likely to evolve dependence than the algal symbiont.},

	abstract = {Bacteria and phages have traditionally been viewed as 'antagonists'. However, temperate phages can transfer genes, which can broaden their bacterial hosts' metabolic repertoire, confer or enhance virulence, or eliminate competing organisms, and so enhance bacterial fitness. Recent evidence shows that phages can also promote biofilm formation leading to population-level benefits for their bacterial hosts. Here, we provide a perspective on the ecological and evolutionary consequences for the bacteria interacting with phages, when phage and host interests are aligned. Furthermore, we examine the question whether bacterial hosts can lower immune barriers to phage infection, thereby facilitating infection by beneficial phages. Taking recent evidence together, we suggest that in many cases temperate phages are to be considered as being mutualistic as well as parasitic, at the same time. Temperate phages can provide a plethora of benefits to bacterial hosts, including the ability to respond rapidly to changes in the environment.Bacterial biofilms can benefit from lysogeny. When phages are induced in a few cells, the lysing cells release nutrients and extracellular DNA locally, which may strengthen biofilm structure. Further, lysis breaks biofilm bonds, allowing for enhanced cell dispersal.In bacterial competition, phages can facilitate bacteriocin release or act as 'weapons' against competitors themselves.Recent evidence indicates that bacterial populations may modulate phage infections, as individual cells may lose immunity or selectively allow infections to occur. The capacity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems to discriminate between lytic and temperate phages (based on gene expression) may enable bacterial hosts to selectively permit temperate phages to enter.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria and plastids evolved from free-living bacteria, but are now considered integral parts of the eukaryotic species in which they live. Therefore, they are implicitly called by the same eukaryotic species name. Historically, mitochondria and plastids were known as "organelles", even before their bacterial origin became fully established. However, since orga-nelle evolution by endosymbiosis has become an established theory in biology, more and more endosym-biotic systems have been discovered that show various levels of host/symbiont integration. In this context, the distinction between "host/symbiont" and "eukary-ote/organelle" systems is currently unclear. The criteria that are commonly considered are genetic integration (via gene transfer from the endosymbiont to the nucleus), cellular integration (synchronization of the cell cycles), and metabolic integration (the mutual dependency of the metabolisms). Here, I suggest that these criteria should be evaluated according to the resulting coupling of genetic recombination between individuals and congruence of effective population sizes, which determines if independent speciation is possible for either of the partners. I would like to call this aspect of integration "sexual symbiont integra-tion". If the partners lose their independence in speci-ation, I think that they should be considered one species. The partner who maintains its genetic recombina-tion mechanisms and life cycle should then be the name giving "host"; the other one would be the orga-nelle. Distinguishing between organelles and symbi-onts according to their sexual symbiont integration is independent of any particular mechanism or structural property of the endosymbiont/host system under investigation .},

Nevertheless, it is often unclear what fitness actually is, and its meaning often depends on the context. Here we argue that fitness should not be a basal ingredient in verbal or mathematical descriptions of evolution. Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on a number of central issues in evolution.},

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that species interactions such as competition and predation can indirectly alter interactions with other community members, including parasites. For example, presence of predators can induce behavioural defences in the prey, resulting in a change in susceptibility to parasites. Such predator-induced phenotypic changes may be especially pervasive in prey with discrete larval and adult stages, for which exposure to predators during larval development can have strong carry-over effects on adult phenotypes. To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has examined possible carry-over effects of predator exposure on pathogen transmission. We addressed this question using a natural food web consisting of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the mosquito vector Anopheles coluzzii and a backswimmer, an aquatic predator of mosquito larvae. Although predator exposure did not significantly alter mosquito susceptibility to P. falciparum, it incurred strong fitness costs on other key mosquito life-history traits, including larval development, adult size, fecundity and longevity. Using an epidemiological model, we show that larval predator exposure should overall significantly decrease malaria transmission. These results highlight the importance of taking into account the effect of environmental stressors on disease ecology and epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Levins's fitness set approach has shaped the intuition of many evolutionary ecologists about resource specialization: if the set of possible phenotypes is convex, a generalist is favored, while either of the two specialists is predicted for concave phenotype sets. An important aspect of Levins's approach is that it explicitly excludes frequency-dependent selection. Frequency dependence emerged in a series of models that studied the degree of character displacement of two consumers coexisting on two resources. Surprisingly, the evolutionary dynamics of a single consumer type under frequency dependence has not been studied in detail. We analyze a model of one evolving consumer feeding on two resources and show that, depending on the trait considered to be subject to evolutionary change, selection is either frequency independent or frequency dependent. This difference is explained by the effects different foraging traits have on the consumer-resource interactions. If selection is frequency dependent, then the population can become dimorphic through evolutionary branching at the trait value of the generalist. Those traits with frequency-independent selection, however, do indeed follow the predictions based on Levins's fitness set approach. This dichotomy in the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in the same foraging process was not previously recognized.},

@article{Oatley1991,
	abstract = {In the aftermath of 9/11, out of the numbness resulting from the horror of the events and the desperate attempts to go on with "business as usual" in the midst of a new, altered reality, there emerged in the United States a representation of a world order disrupted by terrorism - a world order based on the opposition between good and evil or, in the words of then-president George W. Bush, "us" and "the terrorists." Ironically, this interpretation of "the 'mother evenf , the pure event that concentrates in itself all the events that never took place," as Jean Baudrillard put it, was an attempt to reframe the event in the context of traditional representations, such as those that led to the old mind-set of American "manifest destiny" to bring the "good" of democracy to non-democratic countries.1 The persistence of expressions such as "rogue states" and "axis of evil" in political discourse, as well as continuing efforts to turn Afghanistan into a peaceful, democratic country a decade after 9/11, attest to the vividness of such representations.                 The media indeed played no small part in conveying such ideas, as they focused on the attack on the Pentagon much less than on the attacks that had the Twin Towers crumbling like a pack of cards, leaving millions of tonnes of debris in what would be henceforth referred to as "Ground Zero." Thus the media chose to display the horrific scenario that so many Hollywood movies had previously envisaged, leading to what Baudrillard called an "immoral fascination" as "[the] spectacle of terrorism imposes the terrorism of the spectacle."8 The media also chose to label the events as "an attack on America," interpreting the World Trade Center as a symbol of United States' hegemony.9 This choice played an important part in the development of new representations of the world order after 9/11 in the United States. As Deborah Wilkins Newman explains, in certain situations, individuals or groups may be "responding more to popular labels given the event than to the actual event."10 By describing the events of 9/11 as an "act of war"11 against American ideals and values and overlooking the individual tragedies, the media helped to build representations of 9/11 as an external attack to which the whole nation had to answer by reinforcing its own identity and demarcating the line between the "self" and the "other."12                 In her article on the issue of "living together" in Canada since 9/11, Lynne Franji{\'{e}} highlights the processes whereby societal representations of the Canadian Arab community form in Canada and also shows how the Canadian Arab community reacted to such representations. Franji{\'{e}} borrows from G.A. Fine's definition of "ideoculture" as "a system of knowledge, beliefs, behaviours, and customs peculiar to an interacting group to which members refer and employ as the basis of further interaction" to explain differences in how the Canadian Arab community and the rest of Canadian society interpret the post-9/11 context. By underlining some features of the "ideolanguage" ("the language used by an individual or a group of individuals and which reflects this system of knowledge, beliefs, behaviours, customs and values," according to Fine) that groups or sub-groups with specific political views may use, Franji{\'{e}} shows that cultural differences here do not amount to a clash of civilizations of the type Samuel Huntington described but a clash of perceptions, as Mathieu Guid{\`{e}}re and Newton Howard put it.22},

@article{Dybdahl2014,
	abstract = {abstract: Mathematical models of the coevolutionary process have uncovered consequences of host-parasite interactions that go well beyond the traditional realm of the Red Queen, potentially explaining several important evolutionary transitions. However, these models also demonstrate that the specific consequences of coevolution are sensitive to the structure of the infection matrix, which is embedded in models to describe the likelihood of infection in encounters be-tween specific host and parasite genotypes. Traditional cross-infection approaches to estimating infection matrices might be unreliable be-cause evolutionary dynamics and experimental sampling lead to missing genotypes. Consequently, our goal is to identify the likely structure of infection matrices by synthesizing molecular mechanisms of host immune defense and parasite counterdefense with coevolu-tionary models. This synthesis reveals that the molecular mechanisms of immune reactions, although complex and diverse, conform to two basic models commonly used within coevolutionary theory: match-ing infection and targeted recognition. Our synthesis also overturns conventional wisdom, revealing that the general models are not tax-onomically restricted but are applicable to plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Finally, our synthesis identifies several important areas for future research that should improve the explanatory power of coevolutionary models. The most important among these include empirical studies to identify the molecular hotspots of genotypic specificity and theoretical studies examining the consequences of matrices that more accurately represent multistep infection processes and quantitative defenses.},

	abstract = {Microbes that protect their hosts from pathogenic infection are widespread components of the microbiota of both plants and animals. It has been found that interactions between `defensive' microbes and pathogens can be genotype-specific and even underlie the variation in host resistance to pathogenic infection. These observations suggest a dynamic co-evolutionary association between pathogens and defensive microbes, but direct evidence of co-evolution is lacking. We tested the hypothesis that defensive microbes and pathogens could co-evolve within host populations by co-passaging a microbe with host-defensive properties (Enterococcus faecalis) and a pathogen (Staphylococcus aureus) within Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Using both phenotypic and genomic analyses across evolutionary time, we found patterns of pathogen local adaptation and defensive microbe--pathogen co-evolution via fluctuating selection dynamics. Moreover, co-evolution with defensive microbes resulted in more rapid and divergent pathogen evolution compared to pathogens evolved independently in host populations. Taken together, our results indicate the potential for defensive microbes and pathogens to co-evolve, driving interaction specificity and pathogen evolutionary divergence in the absence of host evolution.},

Evolutionary drivers affecting niche differentiation and resource specialization have focused on the role of trade-offs. Here, however, we explore how the role of cooperation, mediated through altruistic behaviors, and classic resource-consumer dynamics can influence the evolution of resource utilization. Using an evolutionary invasion approach, we investigate how critical thresholds in levels of altruism are needed for resource specialization to arise and be maintained. Differences between complementary (essential) and substitutable resources affect the evolution of resource generalists. The strength of resource preferences coupled with the levels of altruism are predicted to influence the evolution of generalism. Coupling appropriate evolutionary game and ecological dynamics lead to novel expectations in the feedbacks between social behaviors and population dynamics for understanding classic ecological problems.},

Some of these interactions are facultative symbioses, in which one partner is not essential to the other. Facultative symbioses are expected to be transitional stages along an evolutionary trajectory toward obligate relationships. We tested this evolutionary theory prediction in Ca. Glomeribacter gigasporarum, nonessential endosymbionts of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota). We found that heritable facultative mutualisms can be both ancient and evolutionarily stable. We detected significant patterns of codivergence between the partners that we would only expect in obligate associations. Using codiverging partner pairs and the fungal fossil record, we established that the GlomeromycotaGlomeribacter symbiosis is at least 400 million years old. Despite clear signs of codivergence, we determined that the Glomeribacter endobacteria engage in recombination and host switching, which display patterns indicating that the association is not evolving toward reciprocal dependence. We postulate that low frequency of recombination in heritable endosymbionts together with host switching stabilize facultative mutualisms over extended evolutionary times.},

	abstract = {We examine the evolutionary dynamics of resistance to parasites through acquired immunity. Resistance can be achieved through the innate mechanisms of avoidance of infection and reduced pathogenicity once infected, through recovery from infection and through remaining immune to infection: acquired immunity. We assume that each of these mechanisms is costly to the host and find that the evolutionary dynamics of innate immunity in hosts that also have acquired immunity are quantitatively the same as in hosts that possess only innate immunity. However, compared with resistance through avoidance or recovery, there is less likely to be polymorphism in the length of acquired immunity within populations. Long-lived organisms that can recover at intermediate rates faced with fast-transmitting pathogens that cause intermediate pathogenicity (mortality of infected individuals) are most likely to evolve long-lived acquired immunity. Our work emphasizes that because whether or not acquired immunity is beneficial depends on the characteristics of the disease, organisms may be selected to only develop acquired immunity to some of the diseases that they encounter.},

Less well known, however, is that host jumps also occur with more complex pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. In extreme cases, these host jumps even cross kingdom of life barriers. A number of requirements need to be met to enable a microorganism to cross such kingdom barriers. Potential cross-kingdom pathogenic microorganisms must be able to come into close and frequent contact with potential hosts, and must be able to overcome or evade host defences. Reproduction on, in, or near the new host will ensure the transmission or release of successful genotypes. An unexpectedly high number of cross-kingdom host shifts of bacterial and fungal pathogens are described in the literature. Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms underlying these shifts show commonalities. The evolution of pathogenicity towards novel hosts may be based on traits that were originally developed to ensure survival in the microorganism's original habitat, including former hosts.},

This work has dealt with the relative merits of various strategies (such as tit-for-tat) when players who recognize each other meet repeatedly, and more recently with ensembles of strategies and with the effects of occasional errors. Here we neglect all strategical niceties or memories of past encounters, considering only two simple kinds of players: those who always cooperate and those who always defect. We explore the consequences of placing these players in a two-dimensional spatial array: in each round, every individual 'plays the game' with the immediate neighbours; after this, each site is occupied either by its original owner or by one of the neighbours, depending on who scores the highest total in that round; and so to the next round of the game. This simple, and purely deterministic, spatial version of the Prisoners' Dilemma, with no memories among players and no strategical elaboration, can generate chaotically changing spatial patterns, in which cooperators and defectors both persist indefinitely (in fluctuating proportions about predictable long-term averages). If the starting configurations are sufficiently symmetrical, these ever-changing sequences of spatial patterns---dynamic fractals---can be extraordinarily beautiful, and have interesting mathematical properties. There are potential implications for the dynamics of a wide variety of spatially extended systems in physics and biology.},

It complements comparable methods developed for discrete-time dynamics modelled with matrix or integral projection models. The basic idea behind the method is to use Lotka's integral equation for the population growth rate and compute the integral occurring in that equation by integrating an ordinary differential equation, analogous to recently derived methods to compute steady-states of physiologically structured population models.

A model is constructed to examine the evolution of costly host resistance to directly transmitted microparasites and these three distinct mechanisms of avoidance, recovery and tolerance are compared. In each case polymorphism is more likely between very dissimilar strains and resistance (by which we mean the resistant strain alone) is always more likely to occur in hosts with high intrinsic productivity. However, the region where polymorphism occurs is relatively much smaller when resistance is through reduced pathogenicity. In particular, polymorphism with highly resistant strains requires correspond-ingly high costs. This is in contrast to avoidance or recovery resistance, where polymorphism can also occur when high resistance is associated with small costs due to the inability of highly resistant strains with low susceptibility or high recovery to support the parasite alone and hence resist invasion by the susceptible strain. Relatedly, resistance through avoidance and recovery is favoured in response to less pathogenic parasites.},

In an emerging mutualistic model system, insect-pathogenic bacteria Photorhabdus and their insect-parasitic nematode partner Heterorhabditis, we found that the bacteria undergo major transcriptional reshaping in the nematode intestine. Besides general starvation mechanisms, the bacteria induce cellular acidification to slow down growth, switch to pentose phosphate pathway to overcome oxidative stress and nutrition limitation, and shed motility but develop biofilm to persist in the nematode intestine until being released into the insect hemolymph. These findings demonstrate how the symbiotic bacteria reduce their nutritional dependence on the enduring nematode partner to ensure successful transmission of the couple to the next insect host.},

	abstract = {Diversification in agricultural cropping patterns is widely practised to delay the build-up of virulent races that can overcome host resistance in pathogen populations. This can lead to balanced polymorphism, but the long-term consequences of this strategy for the evolution of crop pathogen populations are still unclear. The widespread occurrence of sibling species and reproductively isolated sub-species among fungal and oomycete plant pathogens suggests that evolutionary divergence is common. This paper develops a mathematical model of host-pathogen interactions using a simple framework of two hosts to analyse the influences of sympatric host heterogeneity on the long-term evolutionary behaviour of plant pathogens. Using adaptive dynamics, which assumes that sequential mutations induce small changes in pathogen fitness, we show that evolutionary outcomes strongly depend on the shape of the trade-off curve between pathogen transmission on sympatric hosts. In particular, we determine the conditions under which the evolutionary branching of a monomorphic into a dimorphic population occurs, as well as the conditions that lead to the evolution of specialist (single host range) or generalist (multiple host range) pathogen populations.},

However, empirical evidence demonstrating the existence and nature of intraspecific competition is lacking for many parasites. Here, we compared within-host competitiveness between genetic strains of Schistosoma mansoni with high (HIGH-V) or low (LOW-V) virulence to their intermediate snail host, Biomphalaria glabrata. Groups of snails were exposed to either one or the other of two parasite strains, or a mixed infection of both strains, and the resulting progeny were identified using a molecular marker. In two separate experiments investigating simultaneous and sequential infections, we demonstrated that the lifetime reproductive success of parasite strain HIGH-V was reduced in the presence of a faster replicating parasite genotype, LOW-V, regardless of whether it was in a majority or minority in the initial inoculum of the simultaneous exposure or of its relative position in the sequential exposure experiment. Thus, we demonstrate competition between parasite genotypes and asymmetry in competitive success between parasite strains. Moreover, since the less virulent strain investigated here had a competitive advantage, we suggest that a high frequency of multiple infections could favor the evolution of less, rather than more, virulent parasites in this system.},

	abstract = {abstract: Evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models. Yet only one result, Fisher's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. I argue that although its fundamental sta-tus is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplic-ity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other fa-miliar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher's average-excess equation, Robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder's equation, and Fisher's fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing per-fect accuracy. Quantitative genetics has been more productive of fun-damental theorems than population genetics, probably because its em-pirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection states that natural selection increases the mean fitness at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance for fitness (Fisher 1930). The name he bestowed on it makes it clear that he viewed it as a very important result, as does his likening it to the second law of thermodynamics. Opinions about it have waxed and waned over the years or, more accurately, waned and waxed, with ini-tially negative views (Kempthorne 1957; Li 1967; Crow and Kimura 1970; Karlin 1975; Nagylaki 1991) being supplanted by more favorable ones (Ewens},

	abstract = {Using a two-locus diallelic population genetic model, we studied the evolution and impact of flammable traits in resprouting plants. A flammability locus' determines the flammable character of a plant and the frequency of alleles at this locus affects the probability that any plant in the population will burn. A linked `disturbance locus' determines how a plant fares in the presence or absence of fire. Thus, the frequencies of alleles at the flammability locus influence evolution at the disturbance locus. The evolution of flammability-enhancing alleles is influenced by asymmetries in the genotypic fitnesses as well as by the base flammability of the population and the genetic structure of the system (with tighter linkage increasing the possibility that the population becomes more flammable). We demonstrate that stable polymorphisms of plants differing in flammability alleles are possible. The magnitude of the organism's impact on the flammable character of the environment influences where such polymorphisms are expected. Furthermore, predictions concerning the evolution of alleles at the disturbance locus based solely on fitness asymmetries may fail due to the influence of plants on their environment. Unusual population dynamics, including stable and unstable cycles of genotypes, are also presented. The relation of this model to the Mutch hypothesis and the recently developed theories of `niche construction' and `ecosystem engineering' is discussed.},

Besides alleviating the occupational risk subjected to volunteers participating in vector surveillance and control, discovery of potent attractants underpins the development and deployment of mass trapping devices for controlling mosquito-borne diseases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A dual-port olfactometer was used to assess behavioural responses of female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes towards synthetic versus natural (whole human emanations and worn socks) attractants. The synthetic attractants included a standard blend consisting of ammonia, carbon dioxide and water; and Ifakara blend 1 (IB1) consisting of various aliphatic carboxylic acids. Natural attractants were obtained from two males known to be less and highly attractive (LA and HA, respectively) to the mosquitoes. Mosquito responses to the volunteers' worn socks were also investigated. The effect of heat (25-27 degrees C) and moisture (75-85{\%}) on the mosquito behavioural responses was determined.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significantly higher proportion of mosquitoes was attracted to each volunteer when compared to the standard blend. Whereas the proportion of mosquitoes attracted to person LA versus IB1 (49{\%} versus 51{\%}, respectively; P = 0.417) or his worn socks did not differ (61{\%} versus 39{\%}, respectively; P = 0.163), far more mosquitoes were attracted to person HA relative to IB1 (96{\%} versus 4{\%}; P = 0.001) or his worn socks (91{\%} versus 9{\%}; P = 0.001). Person HA attracted a significantly higher proportion of mosquitoes than his worn socks, the standard blend and IB1 when these were augmented with heat, moisture or both (P = 0.001). Similar results were obtained with person LA except that the proportion of mosquitoes attracted to him versus his worn sock augmented with heat (P = 0.65) or IB1 augmented with heat and moisture (P = 0.416) did not differ significantly.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that olfactory cues are key mediators of the mosquito host-seeking process and that heat and moisture play a minor role.

Most bacterial symbionts share many genomic features including small genomes, nucleotide composition bias, high coding density, and a paucity of mobile DNA, consistent with long-term host association. In this study, we focus on the early stages of genome degeneration in a recently derived insect-bacterial mutualistic intracellular association. We present the complete genome sequence and annotation of Sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont (SOPE). We also present the finished genome sequence and annotation of strain HS, a close free-living relative of SOPE and other insect symbionts of the Sodalis-allied clade, whose gene inventory is expected to closely resemble the putative ancestor of this group. Structural, functional, and evolutionary analyses indicate that SOPE has undergone extensive adaptation toward an insect-associated lifestyle in a very short time period. The genome of SOPE is large in size when compared with many ancient bacterial symbionts; however, almost half of the protein-coding genes in SOPE are pseudogenes. There is also evidence for relaxed selection on the remaining intact protein-coding genes. Comparative analyses of the whole-genome sequence of strain HS and SOPE highlight numerous genomic rearrangements, duplications, and deletions facilitated by a recent expansion of insertions sequence elements, some of which appear to have catalyzed adaptive changes. Functional metabolic predictions suggest that SOPE has lost the ability to synthesize several essential amino acids and vitamins. Analyses of the bacterial cell envelope and genes encoding secretion systems suggest that these structures and elements have become simplified in the transition to a mutualistic association.},

	abstract = {Symbiotic nitrogen fixation by rhizobia in legume root nodules injects approximately 40 million tonnes of nitrogen into agricultural systems each year. In exchange for reduced nitrogen from the bacteria, the plant provides rhizobia with reduced carbon and all the essential nutrients required for bacterial metabolism. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation requires exquisite integration of plant and bacterial metabolism. Central to this integration are transporters of both the plant and the rhizobia, which transfer elements and compounds across various plant membranes and the two bacterial membranes. Here we review current knowledge of legume and rhizobial transport and metabolism as they relate to symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Although all legume-rhizobia symbioses have many metabolic features in common, there are also interesting differences between them, which show that evolution has solved metabolic problems in different ways to achieve effective symbiosis in different systems.},

They have diminutive gene sets that rival some mitochondria and chloroplasts in terms of gene numbers and lack genes that are considered to be essential in other bacteria. These symbionts have numerous features in common, such as extraordinarily fast protein evolution and a high abundance of chaperones. Together, these features point to highly degenerate genomes that retain only the most essential functions, often including a considerable fraction of genes that serve the hosts.

	abstract = {Malaria remains a devastating disease despite efforts at control and prevention. Extensive studies using mostly rodent infection models reveal that successful Plasmodium parasite transmission by the African mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae depends on finely tuned vector-parasite interactions. Here we investigate the transcriptional response of A. gambiae to geographically related Plasmodium falciparum populations at various infection intensities and different infection stages. These responses are compared with those of mosquitoes infected with the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei. We demonstrate that mosquito responses are largely dependent on the intensity of infection. A major transcriptional suppression of genes involved in the regulation of midgut homeostasis is detected in low-intensity P. falciparum infections, the most common type of infection in Africa. Importantly, genes transcriptionally induced during these infections tend to be phylogenetically unique to A. gambiae. These data suggest that coadaptation between vectors and parasites may act to minimize the impact of infection on mosquito fitness by selectively suppressing specific functional classes of genes. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing provides initial evidence for important roles of the mosquito G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in controlling infection intensity-dependent antiparasitic responses.},

Centrioles have a complex, ninefold symmetric structure, and reproduce by an intriguing duplication process. The complexity and apparent self-reproduction of centrioles raises the question of how such a structure could have evolved, making them a favorite topic for theological speculation by 'intelligent design' creationists. In fact, centrioles are capable of robust self-assembly and can tolerate dramatic perturbations while still maintaining basic functionality. Far from being irreducibly complex, centrioles appear to be based on a rather minimal underlying core structure requiring only a handful of genes to construct. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Kooi2003,
	abstract = {In classical population dynamic models all the individuals in a population are assumed to be identical or only population averages are considered. The state of the population is therefore the number of individuals or the total amount of biomass in the population. The mathematical model is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that specifies the time derivative of this population state. Subsequently, the dynamics of an ecosystem where populations interact with each other and with their abiotic environment is usually described by a system of ODEs. The classical models are sometimes called unstructured population models, as opposed to structured population models, which take into account the differences between individuals and characterize an individual by some state. The development of this state is modeled from birth until death, often using a first-order ODE that specifies the time derivative of the individual state. The model is complemented with models for the birth and death of individuals. The structured population model is derived straightforwardly from the individual model using balance laws. The state of a population is no longer a single number; it is the distribution of the individuals over their possible states. If the number of individuals is large, this distribution is continuous instead of discrete. If, in addition, the distribution is a density with respect to the individual state, the population model can be written as a partial differential equation (PDE). The first structured population models use age for the state of the individuals. For many organisms, however, a difference in age alone does not explain the differences in individual behavior, and other state variables such as size or energy reserves are more suitable. This has led to physiologically structured population models (PSPs). The life cycle of the individuals may consist of a number of life stages, such as egg, juvenile, and adult. The distribution of the number of individuals with respect to the state variable may be irregular. The introduction of these two extra components, namely, several life stages and nonsmooth distributions, gave mathematical difficulties in the PDE formulation. Recently, an alternative cumulative formulation in terms of renewal integral equations has been proposed that deals with these difficulties. In this review we describe the various model formulations from a modeling perspective. The dynamics of a population of worms that propagate by division into two unequal daughters serves as an example. We give an overview of numerical methods for structured population models.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotes have evolved and diversified in the context of persistent colonization by non-pathogenic microorganisms. Various resident microorganisms provide a metabolic capability absent from the host, resulting in increased ecological amplitude and often evolutionary diversification of the host. Some microorganisms confer primary metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis and cellulose degradation, and others expand the repertoire of secondary metabolism, including the synthesis of toxins that confer protection against natural enemies. A further route by which microorganisms affect host fitness arises from their modulation of the eukaryotic-signaling networks that regulate growth, development, behavior, and other functions. These effects are not necessarily based on interactions beneficial to the host, but can be a consequence of either eukaryotic utilization of microbial products as cues or host-microbial conflict. By these routes, eukaryote-microbial interactions play an integral role in the function and evolutionary diversification of eukaryotes.},

@article{Blaxter2003,
	abstract = {Nematodes are remarkably successful, both as free-living organisms and as parasites. The diversity of parasitic lifestyles displayed by nematodes, and the diversity of hosts used, reflects both a propensity towards parasitism in the phylum, and an adaptability to new and challenging environments. Parasitism of plants and animals has evolved many times independently within the Nematoda. Analysis of these origins of parasitism using a molecular phylogeny highlights the diversity underlying the parasitic mode of life. Many vertebrate parasites have arthropod-associated sister taxa, and most invade their hosts as third stage larvae: these features co-occur across the tree and thus suggest that this may have been a shared route to parasitism. Analysis of nematode genes and genomes has been greatly facilitated by the Caenorhabditis elegans project. However, the availability of the whole genome sequence from this free-living rhabditid does not simply permit definition of 'parasitism' genes; each nematode genome is a mosaic of conserved features and evolutionary novelties. The rapid progress of parasitic nematode genome projects focussing on species from across the diversity of the phylum has defined sets of genes that have patterns of evolution that suggest their involvement with various facets of parasitism, in particular the problems of acquisition of nutrients in new hosts and the evasion of host immune defences. With the advent of functional genomics techniques in parasites, and in particular the possibility of gene knockout using RNA interference, the roles of many putative parasitism genes can now be tested.},

@article{Schneider1894,
	abstract = {Recently my attention was directed to the tubercle-like growths on roots of Cycas revoluta. A cursory examination showed that they were infested by a nostoc. In my search for the literature on the subject I found few and incomplete references. Between I 870 and I 873 Reinke discovered parasitic Nostocaceae in species of Gunnera and Cycas. Jancz-ewski discovered parasitic algae in mosses, Cohn in Lemna, Kny in Florideae and Strasburger in Azolla. Reinke is to my knowledge the only person calling attention to an Anabaena found parasitic in a specialized parenchyma layer of Cycas roots. His incomplete though exact description has induced me to study the subject more closely. Cycas root tubercles, which are simply short somewhat enlarged dichotomously branched rootlets, are quite common on most of our cultivated cycads. They occur on young as well as on old plants. The youngest plants at my disposal were about two years old. Only a few tubercles were present. A large, well nourished plant about twenty-four years old had many tubercles. They were most numerous near the surface of the soil; a few were wholly above and some were found a foot or more below the surface. Usually they are formed from the ends of rootlets, sometimes from the side of root branches, especially the single unbranched tubercles. In position they show evidence of negative geotropism. This is very marked in tubercles near the surface of the soil. Branching is always dichotomous (see plate III, fig. 3). Branches are short and somewhat spindle-shaped, the ends being bluntly rounded. Why they should branch dichotomously is interesting. It is probably a form of atavism showing the relation of cycas to the vascular cryptogams. Likewise the occasional dichoto-mous branching of leguminous tubercles may indicate a descent from cryptogams.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments on plant defenses against pathogens or herbivores have shown various patterns of the association between resistance, which reduces the probability of being infected or attacked, and tolerance, which reduces the loss of fitness caused by the infection or attack. Our study describes the simultaneous evolution of these two strategies of defense in a population of hosts submitted to a pathogen. We extended previous approaches by assuming that the two traits are independent (e.g., determined by two unlinked genes), by modeling different shapes of the costs of defenses, and by taking into account the demographic and epidemiological dynamics of the system. We provide novel predictions on the variability and the evolution of defenses. First, resistance and tolerance do not necessarily exclude each other; second, they should respond in different ways to changes in parameters that affect the epidemiology or the relative costs and benefits of defenses; and third, when comparing investments in defenses among different environments, the apparent associations among resistance, tolerance, and fecundity in the absence of parasites can lead to the false conclusion that only one defense trait is costly. The latter result emphasizes the problems of estimating trade-offs and costs among natural populations without knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Nutritional mutualisms are ancient, widespread, and profoundly influential in biological communi- ties and ecosystems. Although much is known about these interactions, comprehensive answers to fundamental questions, such as how resource availability and structured interactions influence mutualism persistence, are still lacking. Mathematical modelling of nutritional mutualisms has great potential to facilitate the search for comprehensive answers to these and other fundamental questions by connecting the physiological and genomic underpinnings of mutualisms with ecologi- cal and evolutionary processes. In particular, when integrated with empirical data, models enable understanding of underlying mechanisms and generalisation of principles beyond the particulars of a given system. Here, we demonstrate how mathematical models can be integrated with data to address questions of mutualism persistence at four biological scales: cell, individual, population, and community. We highlight select studies where data has been or could be integrated with mod- els to either inform model structure or test model predictions. We also point out opportunities to increase model rigour through tighter integration with data, and describe areas in which data is urgently needed. We focus on plant-microbe systems, for which a wealth of empirical data is available, but the principles and approaches can be generally applied to any nutritional mutualism.},

The results suggest that the changes that organ-isms bring about in their niche can themselves be an important source of natural selection pressures, and imply that evolution may proceed in cycles of selection and niche construction.},

Specifically, this approach suggests that symbionts with mobile life history stages should evolve toward extremely severe parasitism, vector-borne symbionts should evolve toward severe parasitism in vertebrate hosts and benign parasitism in the vectors, waterborne symbionts should evolve toward severe parasitism, symbionts transmitted by predation should evolve toward severe parasitism in prey hosts and benign parasitism in predator hosts, and vertically transmitted symbionts should evolve toward benign parasitism and mutualism. Detailed reviews of the literature on human diseases support the hypothesized severity of vector-borne and waterborne transmission. Evaluation of the other associations is less detailed, but each association appears to be present. This framework draws attention to the need for detailed reviews of relationships between transmission modes and the nature of symbiotic interactions, and experimental manipulations of transmission.},

	abstract = {1. Cases of flagellate infection of man by Chilomastix mesnili have been reported from nearly every locality in the world. They are fairly abundant in the United States and are often confused with cases of infection by Trichomonas intestinalis. 2. The shape of Chilomastix is pyriform. The body contains the following structures: nucleus, centrosome, primary, secondary, and tertiary blepharoplasts, parabasal, parastyle, peristomal fiber, ventral cytostome, cytostomal flagellum, three anterior flagella, food vacuoles with bacterial inclusions, and a posterior spine-like process, the hold-fast organ. 3. The twisted shape in some flagellates in this case of infection is a temporary condition. It was seen in flagellates taken from the feces of the patient on only two occasions and was never observed among the cultured forms. 4. The cysts of Chilomastix are lemon-shaped and occurred irregularly in the stools of the patient. They have not been encountered thus far in the cultures. 5. Chilomastix mesnili was cultured continuously from January 27 to June 15, 1920, in an artificial medium composed of one part of human serum and four parts of Locke's solution with the addition of a small amount of dextrose. 6. Cultures sometimes remained viable for a period of 1 to 10 days, but generally for a period of 1 to 8 days. 7. The flagellates in the cultures increased in number during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and often the 4th days, after which there was a decrease until all had disappeared. 8. A period of lag, probably 13 hours in length, and followed by a period of great fecundity, characterized the growth of the flagellates during the 1st day in the cultures. 9. The number of flagellates in the cultures varied considerably and often reached 700,000 per cubic centimeter. 10. The bacteria served in part as the food of the flagellates. The bacterial organisms identified in the cultures were Bacillus coli communis, Bacillus coli communior, Bacterium aerogenes, Bacillus alkaligenes, and Bacillus proteus. The proteins of the blood serum, the mineral salts, and the dextrose in the medium may also have proved a source of food for the protozoa. 11. The products of bacterial metabolism, resulting from the growth of the bacteria, their fermentative activity, and their death may explain the rate of growth, reproduction, and death of the flagellates in the cultures. A certain amount of the products of decomposition together with the presence of the bacterial food supply may explain the rapid proliferation of the flagellates during the 1st day and the slower rate up to the 3rd or 4th day. An excess of these products may have inhibited the growth and multiplication of the protozoa, especially after the 3rd or 4th day, and ultimately may have brought about their death and disappearance from the cultures. 12. The initial alkalinity of the medium increased at the death of the culture. It is not believed that the change in alkalinity proved lethal to the protozoa. 13. Binary fission was often observed. The plane of division was median and longitudinal. A paradesmose was formed. 14. Multiple fission also occurred. The flagellate body, ameboid in movement, was a somatella comprised of four zooids. It contained four cytostomes, each with a cytostomal flagellum. The number of anterior flagella was not complete for each zooid. 15. Flagellates, joined in pairs, were often seen during the first 3 days in the cultures. They may represent conjugating forms, but as yet no evidence of the exchange of nuclear substance has been seen.},

In the case of continuum of hosts, stratified by their immune response stimulation rate a, we suggest that F(a) has a minimum because a trade-off exists between virulence to the host induced by the pathogen and virulence induced by the immune response.

	abstract = {In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the main vector of the major human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Convenient laboratory studies have identified mosquito genes that affect positively or negatively the developmental cycle of the model rodent parasite, P. berghei. Here, we use transcription profiling and reverse genetics to explore whether five disparate mosquito gene regulators of P. berghei development are also pertinent to A. gambiae/P. falciparum interactions in semi-natural conditions, using field isolates of this parasite and geographically related mosquitoes. We detected broadly similar albeit not identical transcriptional responses of these genes to the two parasite species. Gene silencing established that two genes affect similarly both parasites: infections are hindered by the intracellular local activator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, WASP, but promoted by the hemolymph lipid transporter, ApoII/I. Since P. berghei is not a natural parasite of A. gambiae, these data suggest that the effects of these genes have not been drastically altered by constant interaction and co-evolution of A. gambiae and P. falciparum; this conclusion allowed us to investigate further the mode of action of these two genes in the laboratory model system using a suite of genetic tools and infection assays. We showed that both genes act at the level of midgut invasion during the parasite's developmental transition from ookinete to oocyst. ApoII/I also affects the early stages of oocyst development. These are the first mosquito genes whose significant effects on P. falciparum field isolates have been established by direct experimentation. Importantly, they validate for semi-field human malaria transmission the concept of parasite antagonists and agonists.},

Each of these insect groups has an obligatory association with a different prokaryotic endosymbiont, and the association is the result of a single infection followed by maternal, vertical transmission of the endosymbionts. The result of this association is the domestication of the free-living bacterium to serve the purposes of the host, namely the synthesis of essential amino acids. This domestication is probably in all cases accompanied by a major reduction in genome size. The different properties of the genomes and fragments of the genomes of these endosymbionts suggest that there are different constraints on the permissible evolutionary changes that are probably a function of the gene repertoire of the endosymbiont ancestor and the gene losses that occurred during the reduction of genome size.

	abstract = {Tolerance and resistance provide hosts with two distinct defense strategies against parasitism. In resistance the hosts "fight" the parasite directly, whereas in tolerance the hosts fight the disease by ameliorating the damage that infection causes. There is increasing recognition that the two mechanisms may exhibit very different evolutionary behaviors. Although empirical work has often noted considerable variance in tolerance within hosts, theory has predicted the fixation of tolerance due to positive frequency dependence through a feedback with disease prevalence. Here we reconcile these findings through a series of dynamic game theoretical models. We emphasize that there is a crucial distinction between tolerance to the effects of disease-induced mortality and tolerance to the effect of the disease-induced reductions in fecundity. Only mortality tolerance has a positive effect on parasite fitness, whereas sterility tolerance is neutral and may therefore result in polymorphisms. The nature of the costs to defense and their relationship to trade-offs between resistance and tolerance are crucial in determining the likelihood of variation, whereas the co-evolution of the parasite will not affect diversity. Our findings stress that it is important to measure the effects of different mechanisms on characteristics that affect the epidemiology of the parasite to completely understand the evolutionary dynamics of defense.},

Problems with this line of reasoning appear when one considers possible trade-offs among the mosquito's life-history parameters, which constrain the attempts by the mosquito and the parasite to maximize their success. Could these constraints differ between the two partners and thus lead to conflicts of interest and what would be the evolutionary and epidemiological consequences of conflicting interests? These questions will be investigated below. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Pairwise invadability analysis is used to examine the evolutionary dynamics of host resistance to microparasitic infection. A continuum of strains of the host differs in susceptibility to infection, with less susceptible strains paying a cost resulting in a lower intrinsic growth rate. With a combination of analytical and graphical pairwise invadability analysis, we show that the evolutionary outcome depends crucially on the shape of the constraint function between resistance and its assumed cost in intrinsic growth rates. When resistance is increasingly costly, a single evolutionarily stable strategy is predicted. Alternatively, with decreasingly costly resistance, we find that the hosts lend to be maximally resistant or not at all resistant. There are conditions under which dimorphism of both these types exists but intermediate resistances do not occur. Independently of the trade-off function used, we are always more likely to get resistant strains of the host when the carrying capacity of the host is high. The pathogenicity of the parasite is also important in determining the likelihood and degree of resistance.},

Some studies even show that coinfections may decrease the overall virulence (the disease-induced mortality of a coinfected host). Yet, epidemiological studies tend to overlook the overall virulence, and within-host models tend to ignore epidemiological processes. Here, I develop an epidemiological model where overall virulence is an explicit function of the virulence of the coinfecting strains. I show that in most cases, a unique strain is evolutionarily stable (in ac-cordance with the model I use here). However, when the overall virulence is lower than the virulence of each of the coinfecting strains (i.e., when coinfections decrease virulence), the evolutionary equi-librium may be invaded by highly virulent strains, leading to the coexistence of two strains on an evolutionary timescale. This model has theoretical and experimental implications: it underlines the im-portance of overall virulence and of epidemiological feedbacks on virulence evolution.},

@article{Hall2017,
	abstract = {Molecular and cellular studies reveal that the resistance of hosts to parasites and pathogens is a cascade-like process with multiple steps required to be passed for successful infection. By contrast, much of evolutionary reasoning is based on strongly simplified, one- or two-step infection processes with simple genetics or on resistance being a quantitative trait. Here we attempt a conceptual unification of these two perspectives with the aim of cross-fostering research and filling some of the gaps in our concepts of the ecology and evolution of disease. This conceptual unification has a profound impact on the way we understand the genetics and evolution of host resistance, ecological immunity, evolution of virulence, defence portfolios, and host--pathogen coevolution. Many biological traits are determined by the progression of stepwise events. Dissecting host--parasite interactions into steps offers great potential for understanding infectious disease biology and evolution. The steps of infection are typically governed by unequal contributions of genetic (G), environmental (E), and G × E effects, allowing unique evolutionary trajectories at each step. Variation at each step has different consequences for hosts and pathogens. A pathogen must pass through all steps until transmission starts or else its fitness is zero. For the host, the profitability of resistance at a given step declines with increasing virulence experienced by the host. Red Queen coevolution driven by negative frequency-dependent selection can occur only at steps with host genotype--pathogen genotype interactions. By contrast, selective sweeps may occur at any step.},

@article{Ravigne2009,
	abstract = {We derive a comprehensive overview of specialization evolution based on analytical results and numerical illustrations. We study the separate and joint evolution of two critical facets of specialization-local adaptation and habitat choice-under different life cycles, modes of density regulation, variance-covariance structures, and trade-off strengths. A particular feature of our analysis is the investigation of arbitrary trade-off functions. We find that local-adaptation evolution qualitatively changes the outcome of habitat-choice evolution under a wide range of conditions. In addition, habitat-choice evolution qualitatively and invariably changes the outcomes of local-adaptation evolution whenever trade-offs are weak. Even weak trade-offs, which favor generalists when habitat choice is fixed, select for specialists once local adaptation and habitat choice are both allowed to evolve. Unless trapped by maladaptive genetic constraints, joint evolution of local adaptation and habitat choice in the models analyzed here thus always leads to specialists, independent of life cycle, density regulation, and trade-off strength, thus raising the bar for evolutionarily sound explanations of generalism. Whether a single specialist or two specialists evolve depends on the life cycle and the mode of density regulation. Finally, we explain why the gradual evolutionary emergence of coexisting specialists requires more restrictive conditions than does their evolutionarily stable maintenance.},

	abstract = {Fifty years ago, Lynn Margulis, inspiring in early twentieth-century ideas that put forward a symbiotic ori-gin for some eukaryotic organelles, proposed a unified theory for the origin of the eukaryotic cell based on symbiosis as evolutionary mechanism. Margulis was profoundly aware of the importance of symbiosis in the natural microbial world and anticipated the evolutionary significance that integrated cooperative interactions might have as mechanism to increase cellular complexity. Today, we have started fully ap-preciating the vast extent of microbial diversity and the importance of syntrophic metabolic cooperation in natural ecosystems, especially in sediments and microbial mats. Also, not only the symbiogenetic ori-gin of mitochondria and chloroplasts has been clearly demonstrated, but improvement in phylogenomic methods combined with recent discoveries of archaeal lineages more closely related to eukaryotes further support the symbiogenetic origin of the eukaryotic cell. Margulis left us in legacy the idea of 'eukaryo-genesis by symbiogenesis'. Although this has been largely verified, when, where, and specifically how eukaryotic cells evolved are yet unclear. Here, we shortly review current knowledge about symbiotic in-teractions in the microbial world and their evolutionary impact, the status of eukaryogenetic models and the current challenges and perspectives ahead to reconstruct the evolutionary path to eukaryotes.},

@article{VanDooren2005,
	abstract = {Waxman and Gavrilets give a timely overview of a line of research which has been given the brand-name Adaptive Dynamics (AD). Regardless of whether the branding was appropriate, AD has been influential. My goal here is not to refute points made by the authors, but rather to try to give insight into the need for developing AD approximations, and to discuss their use and limitations. In his book on selection in age-structured populations, Charlesworth (1994, p. 11) states that there is no easily applicable method to model evolution in arbitrarily structured populations. By combining a few assumptions, there now is such a method, or at least an approximate theory, and that method is known as AD. The main assumptions that have led to a workable approximation are that (1) population sizes are large; (2) populations are composed of types that mutate; and (3) mutation rates are low enough that evolutionary and ecological timescales are separated. The third assumption allows us to consider invasion of mutants and their effects on the population dynamics as separate processes: mutant types appear and perturb the composition of the population slightly. Then, after each appearance of a successful mutant, the ecological dynamics return to a stationary state, for example, a new equilibrium density. Changes in the properties of these attractors over time constitute the evolutionary dynamics of the system and usually involve some change in the composition of the population. In most AD models, that means that the set of common types in the population is modified by invasion and/or elimination},

	abstract = {Caspase-12 is a dominant-negative regulator of caspase-1 (IL-1beta-converting enzyme) and an attenuator of cytokine responsiveness to septic infections. This molecular role for caspase-12 appears to be akin to the role of cFLIP in regulating caspase-8 in the extrinsic cell death pathway; however, unlike cFLIP/Usurpin, we demonstrate here that caspase-12 is catalytically competent. To examine these catalytic properties, rat caspase-12 was cloned, and the recombinant enzyme was used to examine the cleavage of macromolecular and synthetic fluorogenic substrates. Although caspase-12 could mediate autoproteolytic maturation of its own proenzyme, in both cis and trans, it was not able to cleave any other polypeptide substrate, including other caspase proenzymes, apoptotic substrates, cytokine precursors, or proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that normally undergo caspase-mediated proteolysis. The dearth of potential substrates for caspase-12 also was confirmed by whole-cell diagonal-gel analysis. Autolytic cleavage within the caspase-12 proenzyme was mapped to a single site at the large-small subunit junction, ATAD(319), and this motif was recognized by caspase-12 when incorporated into synthetic fluorogenic substrates. The specific activity of caspase-12 with these substates was several orders of magnitude lower than caspases-1 and -3, highlighting its relative catalytic paucity. In intact cells, caspase-12 autoproteolysis occurred in the inhibitory complex containing caspase-1. We propose that the proteolytic activity of caspase-12 is confined to its own proenzyme and that autocleavage within the caspase-1 complex may be a means for temporal limitation of the inhibitory effects of caspase-12 on proinflammatory cytokine maturation.},

To date, our current countrywide knowledge on the host-seeking behaviour of Iranian mosquitoes is mainly confined to host preference which has exclusively come from field studies. Olfactometer is a scientific tool by which more naive aspects of man-vector contact can be clarified under controlled and less biased conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The wind tunnel and stimulus delivery system was constructed from acrylic materials based on previously introduced models with some modifications. Air supply and required light were ensured by a powerful compressor and incandescent bulbs, respectively. Desired level of temperature was maintained by controllable heating radiators. For humidity production a unique in-built piezo system was devised in the course of the air flow. Fine regulators facilitated the continuous generatation of the humidity at a preset level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Titanium tetrachloride smoke plus monitoring of the wind speed revealed that the flow of air was proper and invariable. A desired level of humidity and temperature could be set up in just 10 and 15-45 min, respectively. These physical parameters varied only +/-2{\%} (humidity) and +/-0.15 degrees C (temperature) in a typical 20 min duration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The first sophisticated olfactometer in the field of medical entomology in Iran is reported here. Fast set up and stability of physical parameters are its salient features. It is expected that with the aid of this olfactometer further information on the physiological principles of the host-seeking behaviour of mosquitoes become available soon.},

	abstract = {Most models for coevolution of hosts and parasites are based on the assumption that resistance of hosts to parasites is an all-or-nothing effect. In many cases, for example where parasites require an appropriate receptor on host cells, this is a reasonable assumption. However, in many other cases, for example where hosts mount an immune response, this picture may be too simple. An immune system is expensive to maintain, which poses a question as to how much of its resources a host should allocate to resist parasites: if the risk of infection is low, natural selection may favour hosts with less effective immune systems. As optimal allocation to defence will depend on the force of infection, and the force of infection, in turn, depends on the level of defence in the rest of the host population, a game-theoretic approach is necessary. Here I analyse a simple model for the evolution of the ability to recover from infection. If parasites are not allowed to coevolve, the outcome is a single evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). If the parasites coevolve, multiple evolutionary outcomes are possible, one in which the parasites are relatively avirulent and common and the hosts invest little in recovery ability, and another (the escalated arms race) where parasites are rare but virulent and the hosts invest heavily in defence.},

	abstract = {Because novel environmental conditions alter the selection pressure on genes or entire subgenomes, adaptive and nonadaptive changes will leave a measurable signature in the genomes, shaping their molecular evolution. We present herein a model of the trajectory of plastid genome evolution under progressively relaxed functional constraints during the transition from autotrophy to a nonphotosynthetic parasitic lifestyle. We show that relaxed purifying selection in all plastid genes is linked to obligate parasitism, characterized by the parasite's dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. Evolutionary rates and selection pressure coevolve with macrostructural and microstructural changes, the extent of functional reduction, and the establishment of the obligate parasitic lifestyle. Inferred bursts of gene losses coincide with periods of relaxed selection, which are followed by phases of intensified selection and rate deceleration in the retained functional complexes. Our findings suggest that the transition to obligate parasitism relaxes functional constraints on plastid genes in a stepwise manner. During the functional reduction process, the elevation of evolutionary rates reaches several new rate equilibria, possibly relating to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.},

@article{VanTienderen1991,
	abstract = {Quantitative genetic models are used to investigate the evolution of generalists and specialists in a coarse-grained environment with two habitat types when there are costs attached to being a generalist. The outcomes for soft and hard selection models are qualitatively different. Under soft selection (e.g., for juvenile or male-reproductive traits) the population evolves towards the single peak in the adaptive landscape. At equilibrium, the population mean phenotype is a compromise between the reaction that would be optimal in both habitats and the reaction with the lowest cost. Furthermore, the equilibrium is closer to the optimal phenotype in the most frequent habitat, or the habitat in which selection on the focal trait is stronger. A specialist genotype always has a lower fitness than a generalist, even when the costs are high. In contrast, under hard selection (e.g., for adult or female-reproductive traits) the adaptive landscape can have one, two, or three peaks; a peak represents a population specialized to one habitat, equally adapted to both habitats, or an intermediate. One peak is always found when the reaction with the lowest cost is not much different from the optimal reaction, and this situation is similar to the soft selection case. However, multiple peaks are present when the costs become higher, and the course of evolution is then determined by initial conditions, and the region of attraction of each peak. This implies that the evolution of specialization and phenotypic plasticity may not only depend on selection regimes within habitats, but also on contingent, historical events (migration, mutation). Furthermore, the evolutionary dynamics in changing environments can be widely different for populations under hard and soft selection. Approaches to measure costs in natural and experimental populations are discussed.},

In Bacteria, assessing the contribution of genetic drift to genome evolution is problematic because the usual methods, based on intraspecific polymorphisms, can be thwarted by difficulties in delineating species' boundaries. The increased availability of sequenced bacterial genomes allows application of an alternative estimator of drift, the genome-wide ratio of replacement to silent substitutions in protein-coding sequences. This ratio, which reflects the action of purifying selection across the entire genome, shows a strong inverse relationship with genome size, indicating that drift promotes genome reduction in bacteria.},

@techreport{Brown2007,
	abstract = {Question: We examine strategy dynamics for evolutionary games with vector-valued strategies. Mathematical methods: We use the fitness-generating function (G-function) to derive ESS maximum principle and strategy dynamics along multi -dimensional adaptive landscapes. We apply the dynamics to two models of co-evolution of competitors and one model of predator-prey co-evolution. Results: When several traits evolve simultaneously (vector-valued strategies), a trait changes according to the product of each trait's fitness gradient and the matrix of covariances between the trait and the other traits. Only when these covariance terms are small does each trait in the strategy vector change in the direction of that trait's fitness gradient, similar to the scalar case. In the models, convergent stable points may be minima, maxima or saddle points. And the ESS may ultimately contain one, two or many species at distinct peaks of the adaptive landscape. The predator-prey model illustrates how the ESS strategy for the predator can result in an ESS for the prey that allows for any number of prey species to exist along a (flat) rim of a crater in the prey's adaptive landscape. Key conclusions: In going from a scalar to a vector-valued strategy, the adaptive dynamics become more complicated with respect to fitness gradients, the bestiary associated with convergent stable points increases, the avenues for adaptive speciation and achieving an ESS increase, and the number of non-ESS species that can co-exist ecologically increases. By increasing the dimensionality of the adaptive surface, vector-valued strategies increase the opportunity for frequency-dependent selection to produce the number of species and the appropriate trait combinations for an ESS.},

@article{Doebeli1998,
	abstract = {It is common in evolutionary theory to assume that a mutant type which when rare has a long-term growth rate that is larger than 1 can establish itself permanently. Once the mutant has appeared, its frequency may fluctuate, but it will never fall below a certain threshold, and the mutant will remain in the population. For this argument, it is necessary to assume that the system always relaxes to the same state when the mutant is rare. Here I describe a model where this assumption is violated. The ecological model is set in discrete time and describes a system of two local populations that are coupled by dispersal. In each generation, thee os density-dependant reproduction in each patch, followed by dispersion in the other patch. I assume that the two habitat patches are ecologically identical. In some cases, this system typically has two coexisting population dynamics attractors : one is a chaotic in-phase attractor, on which the two local population densities are always identical to each other ; the other one is an out-of-phase 2-cycle. Evolutionary competition between two different dispersal phenotypes can be studied by assuming that the ecological conditions are the same for both phenotypes. Then the following series of events can be observed : if we start out with a resident moving on an out-of-phase 2-cycle, a mutant with a higher dispersal rate can invade and increase in frquency. But when the mutant reaches a high enough frequency, it induces an attractor shift onto the in-phase attractor, where both phenotypes have local densities are equal in the two patches at all times. Next I introduce a cost of dispersal. The above scenario starts up the same way, but now, as soon as the system moves on the in-phase attractor, the frequency of the mutant starts to decrease  because the mortality due to dispersal is higher for the mutant. But as the mutant becomes rare again, nothing saves it from extinction, because the system remains on the in-phase attractor. The evolutionary scenario described rests on the existence of multiple population dynamic attractors for the resident population, and on the ecological consequences of the evolving traits. It shows that a mutant's invasion may create conditions which lead to its extinction.},

Game theory provides a mathematical language for understanding evolution by natural selection. Continuous-trait game theory starts with the notion of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and adds the concept of convergence stability (that the ESS is an evolutionary attractor). With these basic tools in hand, continuous-trait game theory can be easily extended to model evolution under conditions of disruptive selection and speciation, nonequilibrium population dynamics, stochastic environments, coevolution, and more. Many models applying these tools to evolutionary ecology and coevolution have been developed in the past two decades. Going forward we emphasize the communication of the conceptual simplicity and underlying unity of ideas inherent in continuous-trait game theory and the development of new applications to biological questions.},

We show that the coevolutionary dynamic can be envisaged as a directed random walk in the community's trait space. A quant-itative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilib-rium population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Stable associations between bacterial endosymbionts and insect hosts provide opportunities to explore genome evolution in the context of established mutualisms and assess the roles of selection and genetic drift across host lineages and habitats. Blochmannia, obligate endosymbionts of ants of the tribe Camponotini, have coevolved with their ant hosts for ∼40 MY. To investigate early events in Blochmannia genome evolution across this ant host tribe, we sequenced Blochmannia from two divergent host lineages, Colobopsis obliquus and Polyrhachis turneri, and compared them with four published genomes from Blochmannia of Camponotus sensu stricto. Reconstructed gene content of the last common ancestor (LCA) of these six Blochmannia genomes is reduced (690 protein coding genes), consistent with rapid gene loss soon after establishment of the symbiosis. Differential gene loss among Blochmannia lineages has affected cellular functions and metabolic pathways, including DNA replication and repair, vitamin biosynthesis and membrane proteins. Blochmannia of P. turneri (i.e., B. turneri) encodes an intact DnaA chromosomal replication initiation protein, demonstrating that loss of dnaA was not essential for establishment of the symbiosis. Based on gene content, B. obliquus and B. turneri are unable to provision hosts with riboflavin. Of the six sequenced Blochmannia, B. obliquus is the earliest diverging lineage (i.e., the sister group of other Blochmannia sampled) and encodes the fewest protein-coding genes and the most pseudogenes. We identified 55 genes involved in parallel gene loss, including glutamine synthetase, which may participate in nitrogen recycling. Pathways for biosynthesis of coenzyme A, terpenoids and riboflavin were lost in multiple lineages, suggesting relaxed selection on the pathway after inactivation of one component. Analysis of Illumina read datasets did not detect evidence of plasmids encoding missing functions, nor the presence of coresident symbionts other than Wolbachia. Although gene order is strictly conserved in four Blochmannia of Camponotus sensu stricto, comparisons with deeply divergent lineages revealed inversions in eight genomic regions, indicating ongoing recombination despite ancestral loss of recA. In sum, the addition of two Blochmannia genomes of divergent host lineages enables reconstruction of early events in evolution of this symbiosis and suggests that Blochmannia lineages may experience distinct, host-associated selective pressures. Understanding how evolutionary forces shape genome reduction in this system may help to clarify forces driving gene loss in other bacteria, including intracellular pathogens.},

However, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts retain loci that underlie their unique interaction types, such as genes enabling nutrient provisioning by mutualistic bacteria-inhabiting animals.

	abstract = {Buchnera is a mutualistic intracellular symbiont of aphids. Their association began about 200 million years ago, with host and symbiont lineages evolving in parallel since that time. During this coevolutionary process, Buchnera has experienced a dramatic decrease of genome size, retaining only essential genes for its specialized lifestyle. Previous studies reported that genome size in Buchnera spp. is very uniform, suggesting that genome shrinkage occurred early in evolution, and that modern lineages retain the genome size of a common ancestor. Our physical mapping of Buchnera genomes obtained from five aphid lineages shows that the genome size is not conserved among them, but has been reduced down to 450 kb in some species. Here we show evidence of six species with a genome size smaller than Mycoplasma genitalium, the smallest bacterial genome reported thus far (580 kb). Our findings strongly suggest that the Buchnera genome is still experiencing a reductive process toward a minimum set of genes necessary for its symbiotic lifestyle.},

Studies of the evolution of virulence typically focus on selection acting at the epidemiological or between-host level and demonstrate the importance of trade-offs between disease transmission and virulence rates. Within-host studies reach similar conclusions regarding trade-offs between transmission and virulence at the level of individual cells. Studies which examine selection at both scales assume that between- and within-host selection are necessarily in conflict. We explicitly examine these ideas and assumptions using a model of within-host viral dynamics nested within a model of between-host disease dynamics. Our approach allows us to evaluate the direction of selection at the within- and between-host levels and identify situations leading to conflict and accord between the two levels of selection. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In order for mutualism to evolve, some force must align the interests of the two interacting partners. Vertical transmission can fill this role, but it is still unknown whether mutualism can be stable when vertically transmitted symbionts can evolve toward horizontal transmission. In this article, we investigate how symbionts' transmission mode and virulence should evolve, depending on the relationship between these two traits. We show that pathogens that reduce their host's fecundity can have more complex evolutionary dynamics than those that increase mortality. In some cases, runaway evolution of virulence can drive the host population extinct. In most cases, evolutionary branching results in the differentiation of avirulent, vertically transmitted symbionts from virulent, contagious pathogens. The population of symbionts then becomes polymorphic, and because the least virulent symbionts are the most frequent, the average virulence of symbionts is much lower than it would be in a monomorphic population. When the link between transmission and virulence results from correlated mutational changes and not from fixed constraints, vertically transmitted symbionts do not simply lose virulence; they evolve toward mutualism. We show that the force that stabilizes mutualism in such situations is the competition for transmission between symbionts.},

	abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a theme issue 'Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'. This article reviews research on the evolutionary mechanisms leading to different transmission modes. Such modes are often under genetic control of the host or the pathogen, and often in conflict with each other via trade-offs. Transmission modes may vary among pathogen strains and among host populations. Evolutionary changes in transmission mode have been inferred through experimental and phylogenetic studies, including changes in transmission associated with host shifts and with evolution of the unusually complex life cycles of many parasites. Understanding the forces that determine the evolution of particular transmission modes presents a fascinating medley of problems for which there is a lack of good data and often a lack of conceptual understanding or appropriate methodologies. Our best information comes from studies that have been focused on the vertical versus horizontal transmission dichotomy. With other kinds of transitions, theoretical approaches combining epidemiology and population genetics are providing guidelines for determining when and how rapidly new transmission modes may evolve, but these are still in need of empirical investigation and application to particular cases. Obtaining such knowledge is a matter of urgency in relation to extant disease threats. This article is part of the themed issue 'Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the adaptive responses to competition (both character displacement and niche shift) in a two consumer-two resource model. The model includes density dependence that is unrelated to the resources that are explicit in the model. This could be due to another resource dimension, parasites, or interference competition. Competitors adapt by changing their relative consumption rate constants on the two resource types. This model can result in mutually divergent, parallel, or mutually convergent displacement of competitors. Parallel displacement may entail net divergence, net convergence, or no net change. Parallel change with net convergence is most likely when the competitors have similar constraints on the possible values of consumption rate constants, unequal allopatric abundances, and significant intraspecific density dependence. Numerical calculations of displacements are presented for several models and the effect of a number of different possible alterations of the model are discussed. The evolution of resource handling and processing efficiency, and displacement in the presence of additional selective pressures on the character are considered in detail. The results have implications for questions about maximization of population size, the relationship of character displacement and the competition coefficient, and "null" models in the study of competition. Differences between this and previous theoretical works are discussed. It is argued that conditions allowing parallel or convergent displacement are not biologically unlikely, and possible examples are discussed. Data on resource partitioning seem to be more consistent with the results reached here than with previous theory. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

	abstract = {Virus--plant interactions range from parasitism to mutualism. Viruses have been shown to increase fecundity of infected plants in comparison with uninfected plants under certain environmental conditions. Increased fecundity of infected plants may benefit both the plant and the virus as seed transmission is one of the main virus transmission pathways, in addition to vector transmission. Trade-offs between vertical (seed) and horizontal (vector) transmission pathways may involve virulence, defined here as decreased fecundity in infected plants. To better understand plant--virus symbiosis evolution, we explore the ecological and evolutionary interplay of virus transmission modes when infection can lead to an increase in plant fecundity. We consider two possible trade-offs: vertical seed transmission vs infected plant fecundity, and horizontal vector transmission vs infected plant fecundity (virulence). Through mathematical models and numerical simulations, we show (1) that a trade-off between virulence and vertical transmission can lead to virus extinction during the course of evolution, (2) that evolutionary branching can occur with subsequent coexistence of mutualistic and parasitic virus strains, and (3) that mutualism can out-compete parasitism in the long-run. In passing, we show that ecological bi-stability is possible in a very simple discrete-time epidemic model. Possible extensions of this study include the evolution of conditional (environment-dependent) mutualism in plant viruses.},

	abstract = {Horizontally transmitted parasites are broadly predicted to be more virulent, or costly to host fitness, than those with vertical transmission. This is mainly because vertical transmission, from host parent to offspring, explicitly links the reproductive interests of both parties. Underlying this prediction is a general assumption that parasite transmission success is positively correlated with its virulence. We report results where infection of larval yellow fever mosquitoes Aedes aegypti with the microsporidian Edhazardia aedis was experimentally manipulated. The parasite's complex life cycle allowed comparisons between estimates of horizontal and vertical transmission on host fitness. Our measure of virulence was the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of adult female wings. Hosts harbouring spores showed higher FAs than controls. Horizontally transmitting spores were associated with higher FAs than vertically transmitting spores. Furthermore, within hosts FA correlated positively with the number of horizontally transmitting spores, while no relation was seen with the number of vertically transmitting spores. A developmental mechanism uncoupling the relationship between vertical transmission and virulence is proposed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we argue that two-species models of mutualism may be oversimplifications of the real world that lead to erroneous predictions. We present a fourspecies model of a pollination mutualism embedded in other types of community interactions. Conclusions derived from two-species models about the destabilizing effect of mutualisms are misleading when applied to the present scenario; although the mutualisms are locally destabilizing, the effect is more than canceled by an increased chance of feasibility. The crucial difference is the interaction of the mutualists with other species in a larger web. Furthermore, community persistence (without unrealistic population explosion), arguably a superior ecological criterion, is greatly enhanced by the presence of mutualisms. Therefore, we predict that mutualisms should be common in the real world, a prediction matching empirial findings and in contrast to the predictions from local stability analysis of basic twospecies models. This method of stabilizing a mutualism appears superior in some ways to the often-used method of introducing density dependence in the strength of the mutualism, because it permits obligate mutualisms to exist even at low densities, again matching empirical findings. Lastly, this study is an example of how complex model assemblages can behave qualitatively differently from analogous simpler ones.},

@article{Hartmann2017,
	abstract = {Mutually beneficial interactions between species (mutualisms) shaped the evolution of eukaryotes and remain critical to the survival of species globally [1, 2]. Theory predicts that hosts should pass mutualist symbionts to their offspring (vertical transmission) [3--8]. However, offspring acquire symbionts from the environment in a surprising number of species (horizontal acquisition) [9--12]. A classic example of this paradox is the reef-building corals, in which 71{\%} of species horizontally acquire algal endosymbionts [9]. An untested hypothesis explaining this paradox suggests that horizontal acquisition allows offspring to avoid symbiont-induced harm early in life. We reconstructed the evolution of symbiont transmission across 252 coral species and detected evolutionary transitions consistent with costs of vertical transmission among broadcast spawners, whose eggs tend to be positively buoyant and aggregate at the sea surface. Broadcasters with vertical transmission produce eggs with traits that favor reduced buoyancy (less wax ester lipid) and rapid development to the swimming stage (small egg size), both of which decrease the amount of time offspring spend at the sea surface. Wax ester provisioning decreased after vertically transmitting species evolved brooding from broadcasting, indicating that reduced buoyancy evolves only when offspring bear symbionts. We conclude that horizontal acquisition protects offspring from damage caused by high light and temperatures near the sea surface while providing benefits from enhanced fertilization and outcrossing. These findings help explain why modes of symbiont transmission and reproduction are strongly associated in corals and highlight benefits of delaying mutualist partnerships, offering an additional hypothesis for the pervasiveness of this theoretically paradoxical strategy. Hartmann et al. find evolutionary support for a hypothesis explaining why many coral species do not pass algal symbionts to their offspring, despite their necessity later in life. In addition to allowing offspring to acquire beneficial symbionts, lacking symbionts at birth may allow offspring to avoid harm while being fertilized at the sea surface.},

@article{Stoecker2009,
	abstract = {Acquisition of phototrophy is widely distributed in the eukaryotic tree of life and can involve algal endosymbiosis or plastid retention from green or red origins. Species with acquired phototrophy are important components of diversity in aquatic ecosystems, but there are major differences in host and algal taxa involved and in niches of protists with acquired phototrophy in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Organisms that carry out acquired phototrophy are usually mixotrophs, but the degree to which they depend on phototrophy is variable. Evidence suggests that 'excess carbon' provided by acquired phototrophy has been important in supporting major evolutionary innovations that are crucial to the current ecological roles of these protists in aquatic ecosystems. Acquired phototrophy occurs primarily among radiolaria, foraminifera, ciliates and dinoflagellates, but is most ecologically important among the first three. Acquired phototrophy in foraminifera and radiolaria is crucial to their contributions to carbonate, silicate, strontium, and carbon flux in subtropical and tropical oceans. Planktonic ciliates with algal kleptoplastids are important in marine and fresh waters, whereas ciliates with green algal endosymbionts are mostly important in freshwaters. The phototrophic ciliate Myrionecta rubra can be a major primary producer in coastal ecosystems. Our knowledge of how acquired phototrophy influences trophic dynamics and biogeochemical cycles is rudimentary; we need to go beyond traditional concepts of 'plant' and 'animal' functions to progress in our understanding of aquatic microbial ecology. This is a rich area for exploration using a combination of classical and molecular techniques, laboratory and field research, and physiological and ecosystem modeling. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) derived from dietary and salivary inorganic nitrogen oxides foment innate host defenses associated with the acidity of the stomach. The mechanisms by which these reactive species exert antimicrobial activity in the gastric lumen are, however, poorly understood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The genetically tractable acid tolerance response (ATR) that enables enteropathogens to survive harsh acidity was screened for signaling pathways responsive to RNS. The nitric oxide (NO) donor spermine NONOate derepressed the Fur regulon that controls secondary lines of resistance against organic acids. Despite inducing a Fur-mediated adaptive response, acidified RNS largely repressed oral virulence as demonstrated by the fact that Salmonella bacteria exposed to NO donors during mildly acidic conditions were shed in low amounts in feces and exhibited ameliorated oral virulence. NO prevented Salmonella from mounting a de novo ATR, but was unable to suppress an already functional protective response, suggesting that RNS target regulatory cascades but not their effectors. Transcriptional and translational analyses revealed that the PhoPQ signaling cascade is a critical ATR target of NO in rapidly growing Salmonella. Inhibition of PhoPQ signaling appears to contribute to most of the NO-mediated abrogation of the ATR in log phase bacteria, because the augmented acid sensitivity of phoQ-deficient Salmonella was not further enhanced after RNS treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Since PhoPQ-regulated acid resistance is widespread in enteric pathogens, the RNS-mediated inhibition of the Salmonella ATR described herein may represent a common component of innate host defenses.},

A common misconception in medical and public health professions is that S. stercoralis in its biology is akin to other intestinal nematodes, such as the hookworms. Despite original evidence provided by medical and veterinary research about this unique helminth, many assumptions have entered the scientific literature. This helminth is set apart from others that commonly affect humans by (a) the internal autoinfective cycle with autoinfective larvae randomly migrating through tissue, parthenogenesis, and the potential for lifelong infection in the host, the profound pathology occurring in hyperinfection and systemic manifestations of strongyloidiasis, and (b) a limited external cycle with a single generation of free-living adults. This paper aims to review and discuss original research on the unique life cycle of S. stercoralis that distinguishes it from other helminths and highlight areas where increased understanding of the parasite's biology might lead to improved public health prevention and control strategies.},

The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is the main theoretical tool to study cooperation, but this model ignores ecological differences between partners and assumes that amounts exchanged cannot themselves evolve. A more realistic model incorporating these features shows that strategies that succeed with fixed exchanges (e.g., Tit-for-Tat) cannot explain mutualism when exchanges vary because the amount exchanged evolves to 0. For mutualism to evolve, increased investments in a partner must yield increased returns, and spatial structure in competitive interactions is required. Under these biologically plausible assumptions , mutualism evolves with surprising ease. This suggests that, contrary to the basic premise of past theoretical analyses, overcoming a potential host's initial defenses may be a bigger obstacle for mutualism than the subsequent recurrence and spread of noncooperative mutants.},

	abstract = {Trichinella spiralis is an obligate parasite of animals that has an unusual intracellular life cycle. Investigation of parasitism at the cellular and molecular levels has been challenging because of a shortage of tools for in vitro cultivation of T. spiralis. We have found that T. spiralis larvae molt, ecdyse, develop to adulthood, and reproduce when they are inoculated onto cultured intestinal epithelial cells. Initially, larvae invade and migrate through cells in a monolayer (T. ManWarren, L. Gagliardo, J. Geyer, C. McVay, S. Pearce-Kelling, and J. Appleton, Infect. Immun. 65:4806-4812, 1997). During prolonged culture in Caco-2 epithelial cells, L1 larvae molted and ecdysed with efficiencies as high as 50{\%}. Molting and ecdysis in vitro required entry of the parasite into cells; conditions that prevented entry into cells also prevented ecdysis. When larvae were inoculated at a low density and cultured for 5 to 9 days, as many as 50{\%} of the larvae developed to adult stages. Low numbers of mature male worms with copulatory appendages were observed in these cultures. The majority of worms that survived for five or more days were unfertilized females. Low-density cultures supported development of female worms with embryos at rates of 4 to 5{\%}. These results show that the intestinal life cycle of T. spiralis can be supported entirely by host epithelial cells. Our model should allow more detailed investigation of intracellular parasitism by T. spiralis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Facultative symbionts are common in eukaryotes and can provide their hosts with significant fitness benefits. Despite the advantage of carrying these microbes, they are typically only found in a fraction of the individuals within a population and are often non-randomly distributed among host populations. It is currently unclear why facultative symbionts are only found in certain host individuals and populations. Here we provide evidence for a mechanism to help explain this phenomenon: that when symbionts interact with non-native host genotypes it can limit the horizontal transfer of symbionts to particular host lineages and populations of related hosts. RESULTS Using reciprocal transfections of the facultative symbiont Hamiltonella defensa into different pea aphid clones, we demonstrate that particular symbiont strains can cause high host mortality and inhibit offspring production when injected into aphid clones other than their native host lineage. However, once established, the symbiont's ability to protect against parasitoids was not influenced by its origin. We then demonstrate that H. defensa is also more likely to establish a symbiotic relationship with aphid clones from a plant-adapted population (biotype) that typically carry H. defensa in nature, compared to clones from a biotype that does not normally carry this symbiont. CONCLUSIONS These results provide evidence that certain aphid lineages and populations of related hosts are predisposed to establishing a symbiotic relationship with H. defensa. Our results demonstrate that host-symbiont genotype interactions represent a potential barrier to horizontal transmission that can limit the spread of symbionts, and adaptive traits they carry, to certain host lineages.},

	abstract = {Understanding and predicting the spatial spread of emerging pathogens is a major challenge for the public health management of infectious diseases. Theoretical epidemiology shows that the speed of an epidemic is governed by the life-history characteristics of the pathogen and its ability to disperse. Rapid evolution of these traits during the invasion may thus affect the speed of epidemics. Here we study the influence of virulence evolution on the spatial spread of an epidemic. At the edge of the invasion front, we show that more virulent and transmissible genotypes are expected to win the competition with other pathogens. Behind the front line, however, more prudent exploitation strategies outcompete virulent pathogens. Crucially, even when the presence of the virulent mutant is limited to the edge of the front, the invasion speed can be dramatically altered by pathogen evolution. We support our analysis with individual-based simulations and we discuss the additional effects of demographic stochasticity taking place at the front line on virulence evolution. We confirm that an increase of virulence can occur at the front, but only if the carrying capacity of the invading pathogen is large enough. These results are discussed in the light of recent empirical studies examining virulence evolution at the edge of spreading epidemics.},

In this study, we investigated the role of olfaction in An. gambiae discriminative feeding behaviour.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Dual choice olfactometer assays were used to study odour discrimination by An. gambiae to three suspected host plants: Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae), Bidens pilosa (Asteraceae) and Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae). Sugar content of the three plant species was determined by analysis of their trimethylsilyl derivatives by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and confirmed with authentic standards. Volatiles from intact plants of the three species were collected on Super Q and analyzed by coupled GC-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and GC-MS to identify electrophysiologically-active components whose identities were also confirmed with authentic standards. Active compounds and blends were formulated using dose-response olfactory bioassays. Responses of females were converted into preference indices and analyzed by chi-square tests. The amounts of common behaviourally-active components released by the three host plants were compared with one-way ANOVA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, the sugar contents were similar in the two Asteraceae plants, P. hysterophorus and B. pilosa, but richer in R. communis. Odours released by P. hysterophorus were the most attractive, with those from B. pilosa being the least attractive to females in the olfactometer assays. Six EAD-active components identified were consistently detected by the antennae of adult females. The amounts of common antennally-active components released varied with the host plant, with the highest amounts released by P. hysterophorus. In dose-response assays, single compounds and blends of these components were attractive to females but to varying levels, with one of the blends recording a significantly attractive response from females when compared to volatiles released by either the most preferred plant, P. hysterophorus ($\chi$2 = 5.23, df = 1, P {\textless} 0.05) or as a synthetic blend mimicking that released by P. hysterophorus.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that (a) a specific group of plant odours attract female An. gambiae (b) females use both qualitative and quantitative differences in volatile composition to associate and discriminate between different host plants, and (c) altering concentrations of individual EAD-active components in a blend provides a practical direction for developing effective plant-based lures for malaria vector management.},

The classical ap-proach to studying constrained life-history evolution---Richard Lev-ins's geometric comparison of fitness sets and adaptive functions--- is applicable when selection pressures are frequency independent. Here we extend this widely used tool to frequency-dependent selec-tion. Such selection pressures vary with a population's phenotypic composition and are increasingly recognized as ubiquitous. Under frequency dependence, two independent properties have to be dis-tinguished: evolutionary stability (an evolutionarily stable strategy cannot be invaded once established) and convergence stability (only a convergence stable strategy can be attained through small, selec-tively advantageous steps). Combination of both properties results in four classes of possible evolutionary outcomes. We introduce a geometric mode of analysis that enables predicting, for any bivariate selection problem, evolutionary outcomes induced by trade-offs of given shape, shapes of trade-offs required for given evolutionary outcomes, the set of all evolutionary outcomes trade-offs can induce, and effects of ecological parameters on evolutionary outcomes in-dependent of trade-off shape. Evolution in general is driven by a complex interplay be-tween selection pressures and constraints.

The feeding preference behaviour of Anopheline mosquitoes was evaluated in odour-baited entry trap (OBET).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Mosquitoes were captured daily using odour-baited entry traps, light traps and hand catch both indoor and in pit traps. Experimental huts were used for release and recapture experiment. The mosquitoes collected were compared in species abundances.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Anopheles arabiensis was found to account for over 99{\%} of Anopheles species collected in the study area in Lower Moshi, Northern Tanzania. In experimental release/capture trials conducted at the Mabogini verandah huts, An. arabiensis was found to have higher exophilic tendency (80.7{\%}) compared to Anopheles gambiae (59.7{\%}) and Culex spp. (60.8{\%}). OBET experiments conducted at Mabogini collected a total of 506 An. arabiensis in four different trials involving human, cattle, sheep, goat and pig. Odours from the cattle attracted 90.3{\%} (243) compared to odours from human, which attracted 9.7{\%} (26) with a significant difference at P = 0.005. Odours from sheep, goat and pig attracted 9.7{\%}, 7.2{\%} and 7.3{\%}, respectively. Estimation of HBI in An. arabiensis collected from houses in three lower Moshi villages indicated lower ratios for mosquitoes collected from houses with cattle compared to those without cattles. HBI was also lower in mosquitoes collected outdoors (0.1-0.3) compared to indoor (0.4-0.9).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In discussing the results, reference has been made to observation of exophilic, zoophilic and feeding tendencies of An. arabiensis, which are conducive for zooprophylaxis. It is recommended that in areas with a predominant An. arabiensis population, cattle should be placed close to dwelling houses in order to maximize the effects of zooprophylaxis. Protective effects of human from malaria can further be enhanced by keeping cattle in surroundings of residences.},

	abstract = {Several empirical studies put forward sexual selection as an important driving force of sympatric speciation. This idea agrees with recent models suggesting that speciation may proceed by means of divergent Fisherian runaway processes within a single population. Notwithstanding this, the models so far have not been able to dem- onstrate that sympatric speciation can unfold as a fully adaptive process driven by sexual selection alone. Implicitly or explicitly, most models rely on nonselective factors to initiate speciation. In fact, they do not provide a selective explanation for the considerable variation in female preferences required to trigger divergent runawayprocesses. We argue that such variation can arise by disruptive selection but only when selection on female preferences is frequency dependent. Adaptive speciation is therefore unattainable in traditional female choice models, which assume selection on female preferences to be frequency independent. However, when frequency-dependent sexual selection processes act alongside mate choice, truly adaptive sym- patric speciation becomes feasible. Speciation is then initiated in- dependently of nonadaptive processes and does not suffer from the theoretical weaknesses associated with the current Fisherian runaway model of speciation. However, adaptive speciation requires the si- multaneous action of multiple mechanisms, and therefore it occurs under conditions far more restrictive than earlier models of sympatric speciation by sexual selection appear to suggest},

	abstract = {We examine theoretical and empirical results to determine the importance of microbe?microbe interactions in the evolution of defensive traits.  Theoretical models show that the evolution of parasitism and the maintenance of mutualisms in multispecies interactions will depend on interactions with the host as well as with the defensive symbionts. At the community level, selection for defensive traits will vary greatly with ecological context and such spatial or temporal variation itself may stabilize defensive mutualisms. Studies of fungal endophytes within plant hosts demonstrate that endophytes acting as defensive mutualists may derive fitness benefits from the parasite as well as the host and suggest that interactions between co-occurring symbionts within hosts may lead to the evolution of virulence.},

@article{Miller2005,
	abstract = {In response to parasitic infection, hosts may evolve defences that reduce the deleterious effects on survivorship. This may be interpreted as a form of resistance, as long as infected hosts are able to either recover or reproduce. Here we distinguish two important routes to this form of resistance. An infected host may either: (1) tolerate pathogen damage, or (2) control the pathogen by inhibiting its growth. A model is constructed to examine the evolutionary dynamics of tolerance and control to a free-living microparasite, where both forms of resistance are costly in terms of other life-history traits. We do not observe polymorphism of tolerant genotypes. In contrast, the evolution of control may lead to disruptive selection, and ultimately dimorphism of extreme strains. The optimal host genotype also varies with the type of resistance - individuals invest more in tolerance and pay a greater cost. The free-living framework used makes the distinction between tolerance and control explicit but the distinction applies equally to directly transmitted parasites. Due to the evolutionary differences exhibited, it is important to design experiments that distinguish between the two forms of resistance. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The luminous bacterial symbionts of anomalopid flashlight fish are thought to be obligately dependent on their hosts for growth and share several aspects of genome evolution with unrelated obligate symbionts, including genome reduction. However, in contrast to most obligate bacteria, anomalopid symbionts have an active environmental phase that may be important for symbiont transmission. Here we investigated patterns of evolution between anomalopid symbionts compared with patterns in free-living relatives and unrelated obligate symbionts to determine if trends common to obligate symbionts are also found in anomalopid symbionts. Two symbionts, "Candidatus Photodesmus katoptron" and "Candidatus Photodesmus blepharus," have genomes that are highly similar in gene content and order, suggesting genome stasis similar to ancient obligate symbionts present in insect lineages. This genome stasis exists in spite of the symbiont's inferred ability to recombine, which is frequently lacking in obligate symbionts with stable genomes. Additionally, we used genome comparisons and tests of selection to infer which genes may be particularly important for the symbiont's ecology compared with relatives. In keeping with obligate dependence, substitution patterns suggest that most symbiont genes are experiencing relaxed purifying selection compared with relatives. However, genes involved in motility and carbon storage, which are likely to be used outside the host, appear to be under increased purifying selection. Two chemoreceptor chemotaxis genes are retained by both species and show high conservation with amino acid sensing genes, suggesting that the bacteria may actively seek out hosts using chemotaxis toward amino acids, which the symbionts are not able to synthesize.},

The ability to parasitize plants is a derived character that appears to have independently emerged several times in the phylum Nematoda. Morphological convergence to feeding style has been observed, but whether this is emergent from molecular convergence is less obvious. To address this, we assess whether genomic signatures can be associated with plant parasitism by nematodes. In this review, we report genomic features and characteristics that appear to be common in plant-parasitic nematodes while absent or rare in animal parasites, predators or free-living species. Candidate horizontal acquisitions of parasitism genes have systematically been found in all plant-parasitic species investigated at the sequence level. Presence of peptides that mimic plant hormones also appears to be a trait of plant-parasitic species. Annotations of the few genomes of plant-parasitic nematodes available to date have revealed a set of apparently species-specific genes on every occasion. Effector genes, important for parasitism are frequently found among those species-specific genes, indicating poor overlap. Overall, nematodes appear to have developed convergent genomic solutions to adapt to plant parasitism.},

@article{Chapuis2012,
	abstract = {Our current understanding on how pathogens evolve relies on the hypothesis that pathogens' transmission is traded off against host exploitation. In this study, we surveyed the possibility that trade-offs determine the evolution of the bacterial insect pathogen, Xenorhabdus nematophila. This bacterium rapidly kills the hosts it infects and is transmitted from host cadavers to new insects by a nematode vector, Steinernema carpocapsae. In order to detect trade-offs in this biological system, we produced 20 bacterial lineages using an experimental evolution protocol. These lineages differ, among other things, in their virulence towards the insect host. We found that nematode parasitic success increases with bacteria virulence, but their survival during dispersal decreases with the number of bacteria they carry. Other bacterial traits, such as production of the haemolytic protein XaxAB, have a strong impact on nematode reproduction. We then combined the result of our measurements with an estimate of bacteria fitness, which was divided into a parasitic component and a dispersal component. Contrary to what was expected in the trade-off hypothesis, we found no significant negative correlation between the two components of bacteria fitness. Still, we found that bacteria fitness is maximized when nematodes carry an intermediate number of cells. Our results therefore demonstrate the existence of a trade-off in X. nematophila, which is caused, in part, by the reduction in survival this bacterium causes to its nematode vectors.},

Experimental studies have shown that the evolution of host defense mechanisms to a focal enemy is impacted by the surrounding enemy community. Theoretically, the evolution of host defenses against a single enemy population, typically parasites, has been widely studied, but only recently has the impact of community interactions on host-parasite evolution been looked at. In this article, we theoretically examine the evolutionary behavior of a host population that must allocate defenses between two enemy populations, parasites and predators, with defense against one enemy constraining defense against the other. We show that in simpler models the composition of the enemy community plays the key role in determining the defense strategy of the hosts, with the hosts building up defenses against the enemy population posing a larger threat. However, this simple driver is shown to break down...},

@article{Pombert2014,
	abstract = {The evolution of an obligate parasitic lifestyle is often associated with genomic reduction, in particular with the loss of functions associated with increasing host-dependence. This is evident in many parasites, but perhaps the most extreme transitions are from free-living autotrophic algae to obligate parasites. The best-known examples of this are the apicomplexans such as Plasmodium, which evolved from algae with red secondary plastids. However, an analogous transition also took place independently in the Helicosporidia, where an obligate parasite of animals with an intracellular infection mechanism evolved from algae with green primary plastids. We characterised the nuclear genome of Helicosporidium to compare its transition to parasitism with that of apicomplexans. The Helicosporidium genome is small and compact, even by comparison with the relatively small genomes of the closely related green algae Chlorella and Coccomyxa, but at the functional level we find almost no evidence for reduction. Nearly all ancestral metabolic functions are retained, with the single major exception of photosynthesis, and even here reduction is not complete. The great majority of genes for light-harvesting complexes, photosystems, and pigment biosynthesis have been lost, but those for other photosynthesis-related functions, such as Calvin cycle, are retained. Rather than loss of whole function categories, the predominant reductive force in the Helicosporidium genome is a contraction of gene family complexity, but even here most losses affect families associated with genome maintenance and expression, not functions associated with host-dependence. Other gene families appear to have expanded in response to parasitism, in particular chitinases, including those predicted to digest the chitinous barriers of the insect host or remodel the cell wall of Helicosporidium. Overall, the Helicosporidium genome presents a fascinating picture of the early stages of a transition from free-living autotroph to parasitic heterotroph where host-independence has been unexpectedly preserved.},

	abstract = {An open question in evolutionary biology is how does the selection--drift balance determine the fates of biological interactions. We searched for signatures of selection and drift in genomes of five endosymbiotic bacterial groups known to evolve under strong genetic drift. Although most genes in endosymbiotic bacteria showed evidence of relaxed purifying selection, many genes in these bacteria exhibited stronger selective constraints than their orthologs in free-living bacterial relatives. Remarkably, most of these highly constrained genes had no role in the host--symbiont interactions but were involved in either buffering the deleterious consequences of drift or other host-unrelated functions, suggesting that they have either acquired new roles or their role became more central in endosymbiotic bacteria. Experimental evolution of Escherichia coli under strong genetic drift revealed remarkable similarities in the mutational spectrum, genome reduction patterns and gene losses to endosymbiotic bacteria of insects. Interestingly, the transcriptome of the experimentally evolved lines showed a generalized deregulation of the genome that affected genes encoding proteins involved in mutational buffering, regulation and amino acid biosynthesis, patterns identical to those found in endosymbiotic bacteria. Our results indicate that drift has shaped endosymbiotic associations through a change in the functional landscape of bacterial genes and that the host had only a small role in such a shift.},

Studies on a macroevolutionary scale provide an essential framework for understanding the origins of parasite lineages and the patterns of diversification. However, because coevolutionary interactions can be highly divergent across time and space, it is important to quantify and compare the phylogeographic variation in both the host and the parasite throughout their geographical range. Furthermore, to evaluate demographic parameters that are relevant to population genetics structure, such as effective population size and parasite transmission, parasite populations must be studied using neutral genetic markers. Previous emphasis on larger-scale studies means that the connection between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary events is poorly explored. In this article, we focus on the spatial fragmentation of parasites and the population genetics processes behind their diversification in an effort to bridge the micro- and macro-scales. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To quantify these costs, we have developed a model of a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that constrains mass, electron and energy flow at the scale of the individual. When tested and calibrated with laboratory data for the soil bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, the model reveals that the direct energetic cost of nitrogen fixation is small relative to the cost of managing intracellular oxygen. It quantifies the costs and benefits of several potential oxygen protection mechanisms present in nature including enhanced respiration (respiratory protection) as well as the production of extracellular polymers as a barrier to O 2 diffusion, and increasing cell size. The latter mechanisms lead to higher growth efficiencies relative to respiratory protection alone. This simple, yet mechanistic framework provides a quantitative model of nitrogen fixation, which can be applied in ecological simulations.},

	abstract = {The Red Queen hypothesis (RQH) is both familiar and murky, with a scope and range that has broadened beyond its original focus. Although originally developed in the palaeontological arena, it now encompasses many evolutionary theories that champion biotic interactions as significant mechanisms for evolutionary change. As such it de-emphasizes the important role of abiotic drivers in evolution, even though such a role is frequently posited to be pivotal. Concomitant with this shift in focus, several studies challenged the validity of the RQH and downplayed its propriety. Herein, we examine in detail the assumptions that underpin the RQH in the hopes of furthering conceptual understanding and promoting appropriate application of the hypothesis. We identify issues and inconsistencies with the assumptions of the RQH, and propose a redefinition where the Red Queen's reign is restricted to certain types of biotic interactions and evolutionary patterns occurring at the population level.},

	abstract = {Background: A recently developed geometric method makes it possible to explore how the shape of a trade-off determines the outcome of adaptive evolution in any complex model and without committing to a particular functional form of the trade-off function. Aim: Extend the method to the co-evolution of two species. (The two species may be distantly related such as a predator and its prey, or may be closely related like two strategies produced by evolutionary branching.) Results: Thresholds of the local convexity of the trade-off functions are obtained that guarantee evolutionary and convergence stability when a given species pair is singular. In contrast to the single-species case, the condition for convergence is sufficient but not necessary. Criteria for evolutionary branching generalize from the single-species case. A cross-derivative of the invasion fitness determines whether evolutionary branching is possible; this quantity is independent of the trade-offs and if it is negative at a certain species pair, then the trade-offs can be chosen such that evolutionary branching occurs at this point. Worked example: A simple predator-prey model shows how these results can be used to identify trade-off functions such that evolution leads to an evolutionarily stable species pair or to evolutionary branching in either species.},

	abstract = {There is much evidence that some pathogens manipulate the behaviour of their mosquito hosts to enhance pathogen transmission. However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon exists in the interaction of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto with the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum--one of the most important interactions in the context of humanity, with malaria causing over 200 million human cases and over 770 thousand deaths each year. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that infection with P. falciparum causes alterations in behavioural responses to host-derived olfactory stimuli in host-seeking female An. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes. In behavioural experiments we showed that P. falciparum-infected An. gambiae mosquitoes were significantly more attracted to human odors than uninfected mosquitoes. Both P. falciparum-infected and uninfected mosquitoes landed significantly more on a substrate emanating human skin odor compared to a clean substrate. However, significantly more infected mosquitoes landed and probed on a substrate emanating human skin odor than uninfected mosquitoes. This is the first demonstration of a change of An. gambiae behaviour in response to olfactory stimuli caused by infection with P. falciparum. The results of our study provide vital information that could be used to provide better predictions of how malaria is transmitted from human being to human being by An. gambiae s.s. females. Additionally, it highlights the urgent need to investigate this interaction further to determine the olfactory mechanisms that underlie the differential behavioural responses. In doing so, new attractive compounds could be identified which could be used to develop improved mosquito traps for surveillance or trapping programmes that may even specifically target P. falciparum-infected An. gambiae s.s. females.},

	abstract = {From the male peacock's tail plumage to the floral displays of flowering plants, traits related to sexual reproduction are often complex and exaggerated. Why has sexual reproduction become so compli-cated? Why have such exaggerated sexual traits evolved? Early work posited a connection between multicellularity and sexual traits such as anisogamy (i.e., the evolution of small sperm and large eggs). Anisog-amy then drives the evolution of other forms of sexual dimorphism. Yet the relationship between multicellularity and the evolution of sexual traits has not been empirically tested. Given their extensive variation in both multicellular complexity and sexual systems, the volvocine green algae offer a tractable system for understanding the interrelationship of multicellular complexity and sex. Here we show that species with greater multicellular complexity have a significantly larger number of derived sexual traits, including anisogamy, internal fertilization, and secondary sexual dimorphism. Our results demonstrate that anisogamy repeatedly evolved from isogamous multicellular ancestors and that anisogamous species are larger and produce larger zygotes than isogamous species. In the volvocine algae, the evolution of multicellularity likely drives the evolution of anisogamy, and anisogamy subsequently drives secondary sexual dimorphism. Multicellularity may set the stage for the overall diversity of sexual complexity throughout the tree of life.},

@article{Rafaluk2015,
	abstract = {Background: Host-parasite coevolution is predicted to result in changes in the virulence of the parasite in order to maximise its reproductive success and transmission potential, either via direct host-to-host transfer or through the environment. The majority of coevolution experiments, however, do not allow for environmental transmission or persistence of long lived parasite stages, in spite of the fact that these may be critical for the evolutionary success of spore forming parasites under natural conditions. We carried out a coevolution experiment using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and its natural microsporidian parasite, Paranosema whitei. Beetles and their environment, inclusive of spores released into it, were transferred from generation to generation. We additionally took a modelling approach to further assess the importance of transmissive parasite stages on virulence evolution. Results: In all parasite treatments of the experiment, coevolution resulted in extinction of the host population, with a pronounced increase in virulence being seen. Our modelling approach highlighted the presence of environmental transmissive parasite stages as being critical to the trajectory of virulence evolution in this system. Conclusions: The extinction of host populations was unexpected, particularly as parasite virulence is often seen to decrease in host-parasite coevolution. This, in combination with the increase in virulence and results obtained from the model, suggest that the inclusion of transmissive parasite stages is important to improving our understanding of virulence evolution.},

	abstract = {Virulence factors generally enhance a pathogen's fitness and thereby foster transmission. However, most studies of pathogen fitness have been performed by averaging the phenotypes over large populations. Here, we have analyzed the fitness costs of virulence factor expression by Salmonella enterica subspecies I serovar Typhimurium in simple culture experiments. The type III secretion system ttss-1, a cardinal virulence factor for eliciting Salmonella diarrhea, is expressed by just a fraction of the S. Typhimurium population, yielding a mixture of cells that either express ttss-1 (TTSS-1 + phenotype) or not (TTSS-1 - phenotype). Here, we studied in vitro the TTSS-1 + phenotype at the single cell level using fluorescent protein reporters. The regulator hilA controlled the fraction of TTSS-1+ individuals and their ttss-1 expression level. Strikingly, cells of the TTSS-1 + phenotype grew slower than cells of the TTSS-1 - phenotype. The growth retardation was at least partially attributable to the expression of TTSS-1 effector and/or translocon proteins. In spite of this growth penalty, the TTSS-1 + subpopulation increased from {\textless}10{\%} to approx. 60{\%} during the late logarithmic growth phase of an LB batch culture. This was attributable to an increasing initiation rate of ttss-1 expression, in response to environmental cues accumulating during this growth phase, as shown by experimental data and mathematical modeling. Finally, hilA and hilD mutants, which form only fast-growing TTSS-1 - cells, outcompeted wild type S. Typhimurium in mixed cultures. Our data demonstrated that virulence factor expression imposes a growth penalty in a non-host environment. This raises important questions about compensating mechanisms during host infection which ensure successful propagation of the genotype. {\textcopyright} 2011 Sturm et al.},

	abstract = {Host-parasite co-evolution can have profound impacts on a wide range of ecological and evolutionary pro-cesses, including population dynamics, the maintenance of genetic diversity, and the evolution of recombi-nation. To examine the co-evolution of quantitative traits in hosts and parasites, we present and study a co-evolutionary model of a social parasite-host system that incorporates (1) ecological dynamics that feed back into their co-evolutionary outcomes; (2) variation in whether the parasite is obligate or facultative; and (3) Holling Type II functional responses between host and parasite, which are particularly suitable for social parasites that face time costs for host location and its social manipulation. We perform local and global analyses for the co-evolutionary model and the corresponding ecological model. In the absence of evolution, our ecological model analyses imply that an extremely small value of the death rate for facultative social parasites, primarily due to hunting/searching for potential host species, can drive a host extinct globally under certain conditions, while an extremely large value of the death rate can drive the parasite extinct globally. The facultative parasite system can have one, two, or three interior equilibria, while the obligate parasite system can have either one or three interior equilibria. Multiple interior equilibria result in rich dynamics with multiple attractors. The ecological system, in particular, can exhibit bi-stability between the facultative-parasite-only equilibrium and the interior coexistence equilibrium when it has two interior equilibria. Our analysis on the co-evolutionary model provides important insights on how co-evolution can change the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of host-parasite interactions. Our findings suggest that: (a) The host and parasite can select different strategies that may result in local extinction of one species. These strategies can have convergence stability (CS), but may not be evolutionary stable strategies (ESS); (b) The host and its facultative (or obligate) parasite can have ESS that drive the host (or the obligate parasite) extinct locally; (c) Trait functions play an important role in the CS of both boundary and interior equilibria, as well as their ESS; and (d) A small variance in the trait difference that measures parasitism efficiency can destabilize the co-evolutionary system, and generate evolutionary arms-race dynamics with different host-parasite fluctuating patterns.},

	abstract = {Host and tissue specificity Multiplication Mean generation time: factors include scavenging for nutrients and evading host clearance Cytotoxicity Damage to host tissues an understanding of how these traits are related to transmission. Before proceeding, it is necessary to define the term virulence. Virulence often refers to a measure of the capacity of a microorganism to infect or damage a host, and is often quantified by the size of the dose required to infect (IDs0) or to kill (LDs0) 50{\%} of hosts. Molecular studies have shown, however, that virulence is a composite trait and reflects the roles of multiple genes; some of these roles are listed in Box 1. These individual components of virulence will very often be selected independently , and selective pressures may vary between different macro-and microenvironments within a single host or even within a single tissue. In the context of this review, virulence (used here interchangeably with pathogenicity) is defined as the potential (prob-ability and rate) for a pathogen to produce morbidity or mortality in infected hosts. A long-standing, and still common, view of pathogen evolution claims that regardless of the details of transmission, natural selection will tend to favor reduced virulence because living, mobile hosts will transmit the organisms that infect them most efficiently 9'{\~{}}$\,^{\circ}$. In contrast, many recent studies of the evolution of virulence stem from the idea that natural selection can favour strains of intermediate, or even high, levels of virulence if the more-virulent strains have some advantage to offset the loss of transmission opportunities that result from killing or debilitating their hosts n,12. Among the compensating advantages that have been proposed to explain the maintenance of virulent pathogen strains are higher instantaneous rates of transmiss-ibility, increased resistance to host defenses and the ability to compete with other strains of the same pathogen within a single host. Insofar as virulence is a result of pathogen multiplication within the host, each of these mechanisms is plausible because rapid replication will increase the fitness of pathogen strains in the presence of host defenses 13 or other co-infecting strains 14as. If such positive correlations between virulence and other components of pathogen fitness occur, they create an evolutionary trade-off between maintaining long-term transmission opportunities from a given host and rapid reproduction within, and dispersal from, that host. This paradigm lends itself to mathematical models that attempt to describe, for example, how transmission conditions affect the resolution of this trade-off. Depending on the form of the trade-off, these models suggest that a directly transmitted pathogen may evolve towards low, intermediate or high virulence. In the simplest case, pathogens will evolve towards the level of virulence that maximizes their basic reproductive rate (Ro): the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious host in a previously unexposed population H. More-complicated mathematical models, based on the same evolutionary trade-off hypothesis, have also considered the spread of pathogens in structured host populations 16, by a combination of vertical and horizontal transmission 17, or in systems where hosts may be infected by multiple strains of the same pathogen 12,18,19. These models predict that vertical transmission and host population structure will select for strains of less virulence, while multiple infection will select for strains of greater virulence than those that maximize Ro. Other trade-off-based models have concentrated on understanding how the within-host dynamics of competition between strains of the same pathogen TM, the growth of pathogens in the presence of immune mechanisms Is, and sexual transmission 2$\,^{\circ}$ affect the evolution of viru-lence. P.W. Ewald has argued that the linkage between high transmissibility and high virulence governs the evolution of a wide range of infectious organisms 6, The trade-off assumptions behind these models raise the empirical question: what connection, if any, is there between pathogen virulence and other components of pathogen fitness, in particular transmission ability? As early as 1919, W.W.C. Topley recognized that natural selection for increased transmissibility might drive pathogens toward increased virulence, but that this would only occur in cases where the virulence of the pathogen was linked to its rates of replication and transmission 1. Other, more-recent papers have also raised similar questions about the generality of the connection between virulence and transmissibility4'2L},

@article{DeRoos2001,
	abstract = {A ubiquitous feature of natural communities is the variation in size that can be observed between organisms, a variation that to a substantial degree is intraspecific. Size variation within species by necessity implies that ecological interactions vary both in intensity and type over the life cycle of an individual. Physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) constitute a modelling approach especially designed to analyse these size-dependent interactions as they explicitly link individual level processes such as consumption and growth to population dynamics. We discuss two cases where PSPMs have been used to analyse the dynamics of size-structured populations. In the first case, a model of a size-structured consumer population feeding on a non-structured prey was successful in predicting both qualitative (mechanisms) and quantitative (individual growth, survival, cycle amplitude) aspects of the population dynamics of a planktivorous fish population. We conclude that single generation cycles as a result of intercohort competition is a general outcome of size-structured consumer-resource interactions. In the second case, involving both cohort competition and cannibalism, we show that PSPMs may predict double asymptotic growth trajectories with individuals ending up as giants. These growth trajectories, which have also been observed in field data, could not be predicted from individual level information, but are emergent properties of the population feedback on individual processes. In contrast to the size-structured consumer-resource model, the dynamics in this case cannot be reduced to simpler lumped stage-based models, but can only be analysed within the domain of PSPMs. Parameter values used in PSPMs adhere to the individual level and are derived independently from the system at focus, whereas model predictions involve both population level processes and individual level processes under conditions of population feedback. This leads to an increased ability to test model predictions but also to a larger set of variables that is predicted at both the individual and population level. The results turn out to be relatively robust to specific model assumptions and thus render a higher degree of generality than purely individual-based models. At the same time, PSPMs offer a much higher degree of realism, precision and testing ability than lumped stage-based or non-structured models. The results of our analyses so far suggest that also in more complex species configurations only a limited set of mechanisms determines the dynamics of PSPMs. We therefore conclude that there is a high potential for developing an individual-based, size-dependent community theory using PSPMs.},

	abstract = {Parasite-induced modifications of host behaviour are known from a wide range of host-parasite associations. In many cases, these behavioural changes are thought to be adaptive and benefit the parasite by increasing its probability of successful transmission. However, in many cases, energy spent on host manipulation will not be available for other functions, such as growth. These trade-offs suggest that in the absence of other constraints, natural selection will optimize, and not maximize, the influence of parasites on host behaviour. This argument is developed and expanded into theoretical considerations of the evolution of host behaviour manipulation by parasites. Among populations of the same parasite species or among closely-related species, the optimal investment into manipulation, or optimal manipulative effort (ME*), of individual parasites is predicted to increase as (1) typical infrapopulation size decreases, (2) prevalence increases, (3) the longevity of the infected host, or of the parasite in its host, decreases, (4) passive transmission rates decrease, and (5) parasite fecundity decreases. This evolutionary analysis indicates that ecological and life history variables may have played an important role in the evolution of manipulation of host behaviour by parasites.},

@article{Chafee2011,
	abstract = {Transferring endosymbiotic bacteria between different host species can perturb the coordinated regulation of the host and bacterial genomes. Here we use the most common maternally transmitted bacteria, Wolbachia pipientis, to test the consequences of host genetic background on infection densities and the processes underlying those changes in the parasitoid wasp genus Nasonia. Introgressing the genome of Nasonia giraulti into the infected cytoplasm of N. vitripennis causes a two-order-of-magnitude increase in bacterial loads in adults and a proliferation of the infection to somatic tissues. The host effect on W. pipientis distribution and densities is associated with a twofold decrease in densities of the temperate phage WO-B. Returning the bacteria from the new host species back to the resident host species restores the bacteria and phage to their native densities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a host-microbe genetic interaction that affects the densities of both W. pipientis and bacteriophage WO-B. The consequences of the increased bacterial density include a reduction in fecundity, an increase in levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), and unexpectedly, male-to-female transfer of the bacteria to uninfected females and an increased acceptance of densely infected females to interspecific mates. While paternal inheritance of the W. pipientis was not observed, the high incidence of male-to-female transfer in the introgressed background raises the possibility that paternal transmission could be more likely in hybrids where paternal leakage of other cytoplasmic elements is also known to occur. Taken together, these results establish a major change in W. pipientis densities and tissue tropism between closely related species and support a model in which phage WO, Wolbachia, and arthropods form a tripartite symbiotic association in which all three are integral to understanding the biology of this widespread endosymbiosis.},

	abstract = {Explaining the emergence of cooperative behaviours in a selfish world remains a major challenge for sociobiology. The iterated prisoner's dilemma offers a well-studied metaphor with which to explore theoretically the evolution of cooperation by reciprocation. Our current understanding is that 'tit-for-tat' should be the very first step (if not the aim) of evolution towards cooperation, but that mobility of the players in space seems to raise a devastating obstacle to the spread of tit-for-tat, by allowing egoists to exploit cooperation and escape retaliation. The second point is based on models that represent mobility only implicitly (in terms of travelling costs) and assume random interactions. Here we develop a more explicit theory of spatial iterated games: individual mobility is represented in terms of a diffusion process and interactions--defined locally--are inherently non-random. Our model reveals the existence of critical levels of individual mobility allowing for the evolution of cooperation. In fact, tit-for-tat can spread and take over among mobile players even when originating from extreme rarity. The dynamics of invasion of tit-for-tat develop as a travelling wave which propagates the cooperative strategy through space. Significant mobility is required to make the pioneering moves of cooperators towards the front of invasion less hazardous; it also contributes to neutralizing those defectors who may intrude the core of a cluster of cooperative players.},

	abstract = {A great diversity of plants and fungi engage in mycorrhizal associations. In natural habitats, and in an ecologically meaningful time span, these associations have evolved to improve the fitness of both plant and fungal symbionts. In systems managed by humans, mycorrhizal associations often improve plant productivity, but this is not always the case. Mycorrhizal fungi might be considered to be parasitic on plants when net cost of the symbiosis exceeds net benefits. Parasitism can be developmentally induced, environmentally induced, or possibly genotypically induced. Morphological, phenological, and physiological characteristics of the symbionts influence the functioning of mycorrhizas at an individual scale. Biotic and abiotic factors at the rhizosphere, community, and ecosystem scales further mediate mycorrhizal functioning. Despite the complexity of mycorrhizal associations, it might be possible to construct predictive models of mycorrhizal functioning. These models will need to incorporate variables and parameters that account for differences in plant responses to, and control of, mycorrhizal fungi, and differences in fungal effects on, and responses to, the plant. Developing and testing quantitative models of mycorrhizal functioning in the real world requires creative experimental manipulations and measurements. This work will be facilitated by recent advances in molecular and biochemical techniques. A greater understanding of how mycorrhizas function in complex natural systems is a prerequisite to managing them in agriculture, forestry, and restoration.},

@article{Yamamura1996,
	abstract = {In geological history, rapid speciation, called adaptive radiation, has occurred repeatedly. The origins of such newly developing taxa often evolved from the symbiosis of different species. Mutualistic symbioses are generally considered to evolve from parasitic relationships. As well as the previous model of host population with discrete generations, a differential equation model of host population with overlapping generations shows that vertical transmission, defined as the direct transfer of infection from a parent host to its progeny, is an important factor which can stimulate reduction of parasite virulence. Evolution of the vertical transmission rate from both points of view, the parasite and the host, is analyzed. There is a critical level of the rate, below which an evolutionary conflict arises (the parasite would want an increase in the rate while the host would not), and above which both species would correspond to increase the rate. Therefore, once the parasite dominates the evolutionary race so as to overcome this critical level, one-way evolution begins toward a highly mutualistic relationship with a high vertical transmission rate, possibly creating a new organism through symbiosis with perfect vertical transmission. Changes in other parameters may decrease the critical level, initiating one-way evolution. However, changes in traits, probably developed through a long interrelationship in parasitism, do not necessarily induce the evolution of mutualism. Establishment of the ability to make use of metabolic and digestive wastes from the partner certainly facilitates the evolution of mutualism, while improvements in reproductive efficiency of parasites and reduction of negative effects from exploitation in hosts on the contrary disturb mutualism.},

	abstract = {Hosts are typically simultaneously co-infected by a variety of microparasites (e.g. viruses and bacteria) and macroparasites (e.g. parasitic helminths). However, the population dynamical consequences of such co-infections and the implications for the effectiveness of imposed control programmes have yet to be fully realised. Mathematical models may provide an important framework for exploring such issues and have proved invaluable in helping to understand the factors affecting the epidemiology of single parasitic infections. Here the first population dynamic model of microparasite-macroparasite co-infection is presented and used to explore how co-infection alters the predictions of the existing single-species models. It is shown that incorporating an additional parasite species into existing models can greatly stabilise them, due to the combined density-dependent impacts on the host population, but co-infection can also restrict the region of parameter space where each species could persist alone. Overall it is concluded that the dynamic feedback between host, microparasite and macroparasite means that it is difficult to appreciate the factors affecting parasite persistence and predict the effectiveness of control by just studying one component in isolation.},

@article{Jacquin2014,
	abstract = {Trophically-transmitted parasites often change the phenotype of their intermediate hosts in ways that increase their vulnerability to definitive hosts, hence favouring transmission. As a "collateral damage", manipulated hosts can also become easy prey for non-host predators that are dead ends for the parasite, and which are supposed to play no role in transmission strategies. Interestingly, infection with the acanthocephalan parasite Polymorphus minutus has been shown to reduce the vulnerability of its gammarid intermediate hosts to non-host predators, whose presence triggered the behavioural alterations expected to favour trophic transmission to bird definitive hosts. Whilst the behavioural response of infected gammarids to the presence of definitive hosts remains to be investigated, this suggests that trophic transmission might be promoted by non-host predation risk. We conducted microcosm experiments to test whether the behaviour of P. minutus-infected gammarids was specific to the type of predator (i.e. mallard as definitive host and fish as non-host), and mesocosm experiments to test whether trophic transmission to bird hosts was influenced by non-host predation risk. Based on the behaviours we investigated (predator avoidance, activity, geotaxis, conspecific attraction), we found no evidence for a specific fine-tuned response in infected gammarids, which behaved similarly whatever the type of predator (mallard or fish). During predation tests, fish predation risk did not influence the differential predation of mallards that over-consumed infected gammarids compared to uninfected individuals. Overall, our results bring support for a less sophisticated scenario of manipulation than previously expected, combining chronic behavioural alterations with phasic behavioural alterations triggered by the chemical and physical cues coming from any type of predator. Given the wide dispersal range of waterbirds (the definitive hosts of P. minutus), such a manipulation whose efficiency does not depend on the biotic context is likely to facilitate its trophic transmission in a wide range of aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {AbstractEvolutionary conflicts arise when the fitness interests of interacting individuals differ. Well-known examples include sexual conflict between males and females and antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites. A common feature of such conflicts is that compensating evolutionary change in each of the parties can lead to little overt change in the interaction itself. As a result, evolutionary conflict is expected to persist even if the evolutionary dynamic between the parties reaches an equilibrium. In these cases, it is of interest to know whether certain kinds of interactions are expected to lead to greater or lesser evolutionary conflict at such evolutionary stalemates. Here we present a theoretical analysis showing that when one of the interacting parties can respond to the other through adaptive phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary conflict is reduced. Paradoxically, however, it is the party that does not express adaptive plasticity that experiences less conflict. Conflict for the party...},

	abstract = {How should fitness be measured to determine which phenotype or "strategy" is uninvadable when evolution occurs in subdivided populations subject to local demographic and environmental heterogeneity? Several invasion fitness measures, such as basic reproductive number, lifetime dispersal success of a local lineage, or inclusive fitness have been proposed to address this question, but the relationships between them and their generality remains unclear. Here, we ascertain uninvadability (all mutant strategies always go extinct) in terms of the growth rate of a mutant allele arising as a single copy in a population. We show from this growth rate that uninvadability is equivalently characterized by at least three conceptually distinct invasion fitness measures: (i) lineage fitness, giving the average personal fitness of a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; (ii) inclusive fitness, giving a reproductive value weighted average of the direct fitness cost and relatedness weighted indirect fitness benefits accruing to a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; and (iii) three types of reproductive numbers, giving lifetime success of a local lineage. Our analysis connects approaches that have been deemed different, generalizes the exact version of inclusive fitness to class-structured populations, and provides a biological interpretation of selection on a mutant allele under arbitrary strength of selection.},

@techreport{Kaltz2003,
	abstract = {A parasite might be prohibited from investing simultaneously in horizontal (infection of new hosts) and vertical (infection of the current host's offspring) transmission because of developmental, physiological, or evolutionary costs and constraints. Rather, these constraints may select for adaptive phenotypic plasticity, where the parasite uses the transmission pathway that maximizes transmission in the current ecological and epidemiological conditions. By varying environmental conditions for the host's replication, we investigated the plasticity of vertical and horizontal transmission of Holospora undulata, a micronucleus-specific bacterial parasite of the protozoan Paramecium caudatum. We observed a negative correlation between the host's growth rate and the parasite's investment in horizontal transmission. In rapidly dividing hosts, the parasite remained in the reproductive stage and was passed on vertically to the daughter nuclei during mitotic division of the Paramecium. In contrast, at low or negative growth rates of the host, the parasite's reproductive forms differentiated into infectious forms, the agents of horizontal transmission. Furthermore, in treatments that were initiated with a high proportion of individuals harboring horizontally transmitted infectious forms, rapid replication resulted in a switch back from predominantly horizontal to almost exclusively vertical transmission. These results suggest a trade-off between the efficacies of vertical and horizontal transmission, with the parasite switching to horizontal transmission only if conditions for host replication, and thus vertical transmission, deteriorate.},

	abstract = {Almost all aphids harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, Buchnera aphidicola, in bacteriocytes. Buchnera synthesizes essential nutrients and supports growth and reproduction of the host. Over the long history of endosymbiosis, many essential genes have been lost from the Buchnera genome, resulting in drastic genome reduction and the inability to live outside the host cells. In turn, when deprived of Buchnera, the host aphid suffers retarded growth and sterility. Buchnera and the host aphid are often referred to as highly integrated almost inseparable mutualistic partners. However, we discovered that, even after complete elimination of Buchnera, infection with a facultative endosymbiotic gamma-proteobacterium called pea aphid secondary symbiont (PASS) enabled survival and reproduction of the pea aphid. In the Buchnera-free aphid, PASS infected the cytoplasms of bacteriocytes that normally harbour Buchnera, establishing a novel endosymbiotic system. These results indicate that PASS can compensate for the essential role of Buchnera by physiologically and cytologically taking over the symbiotic niche. By contrast, PASS negatively affected the growth and reproduction of normal host aphids by suppressing the essential symbiont Buchnera. These findings illuminate complex symbiont-symbiont and host-symbiont interactions in an endosymbiotic system, and suggest a possible evolutionary route to novel obligate endosymbiosis by way of facultative endosymbiotic associations.},

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to examine whether mutualism is a prerequisite for persistence of exclusively vertically transmitted (from maternal plant to offspring via seeds) fungal endophytes in structured grass metapopulations. Interestingly, endophyte survival does not require plant mutualism, even in a metapopulation consisting of qualitatively identical patches, if vertical transmission of the fungus is perfect, i.e. if all established seedlings in offspring of the endophyte-infected plant are infected. In more realistic situations, when the metapopulation consists of qualitatively different patches, endophyte-infected plants may persist at the metapopulation level even if the vertical transmission is imperfect (due to hyphae inviability or failure to grow into all seeds) and the endophyte decreases the host grass fitness in certain environments. These results have biological importance because they (i) question the requirement of a mutualistic nature in exclusively vertically transmitted symbionts and (ii) emphasize the importance of habitat diversity in relation to symbiont success in vertical transmission.},

We use this as a conceptual model for the dynamics of Toxoplasma gondii, in which the parasite's life cycle includes interactions with the environment. We postulate the infection process to depend on the size of the infective inoculum that susceptible hosts may acquire by interacting with a contaminated environment. Because the dynamical processes associated with the within- and between-host occur on different time scales, the model behaviors can be analyzed by using a singular perturbation argument, which allows us to decouple the full model by separating the fast- and slow-systems. We define new reproductive numbers for the within-host and between host dynamics for both the isolated systems and the coupled system. Particularly, the reproduction number for the between-host (slow) system dependent on the parameters associated with the within-host (fast) system in a very natural way. We show that these reproduction numbers determine the stability of the infection-free and the endemic equilibrium points.

Increased host mortality caused by disease (virulence) reduces a parasite's fitness by damaging its food supply. The fitness costs of high virulence may be offset by the benefits of increased transmission or ability to withstand the host's defences. It has been suggested that multiple infections lead to higher virulence because of competition among parasite strains within a host. A quantitative prediction is given for the ESS virulence rate as a function of the coefficient of relatedness among co-infecting strains. The prediction depends on the quantitative relation between the costs of virulence and the benefits of transmission or avoidance of host defences. The particular mechanisms by which parasites can increase their transmission or avoid host defences also have a key role in the evolution of virulence when there are multiple infections.},

@article{Metz2012,
	abstract = {Adaptive dynamics (AD) is a mathematical framework for dealing with eco-evolutionary problems, primarily based on the following simplifying assumptions: clonal reproduction, rare mutations, small mutational effects, smoothness of the demographic parameters in the traits, and well-behaved community attractors. However, often the results from AD models turn out to apply also under far less restrictive conditions. The main AD tools are its so-called canonical equation (CE) that captures how the trait value(s) currently present in the population should develop over evolutionary time, and graphical techniques for analyzing evolutionary progress for one-dimensional trait spaces like 'pairwise invasibility plots' (PIPs) and 'trait evolution plots' (TEPs). The equilibria of the CE, customarily referred to as evolutionarily singular strategies, or ess-es, comprise in addition to the evolutionary equilibria, or ESSes, also points in trait space where the population comes under a selective pressure to diversify. Such points mathematically capture the ecological conditions conducive to adaptive (Darwinian) speciation. {\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_}{\_} This research benefited from the support of the Chair Mod{\'{e}}lisation Math{\'{e}}matique et Biodiversit{\'{e}} VEOLIA-{\'{E}}cole Polytechnique-MNHN-F.X. 2 1. Context 1.1. Micro-, meso-and macro-evolution Adaptive dynamics was initiated as a simplified theoretical approach to meso-evolution, defined here as evolutionary changes in the values of traits of representative individuals and concomitant patterns of taxonomic diversification. This in contrast to micro-evolution, i.e., changes in gene frequencies on a population dynamical time scale, and macro-evolution, a term that then can be reserved for changes like anatomical innovations, where one cannot even speak in terms of a fixed set of traits. Meso-evolution is more than micro-evolution writ large, and a similar statement applies to macro-versus meso-evolution. Each of these levels has its own emergent phenomena, and its own explanatory frameworks, which in the end should be based on idealised summaries of the outcomes of lower level mechanisms. Trait changes result from the micro-evolutionary process of mutant substitutions taking place against the backdrop of a genetic architecture and developmental system as deliverers of mutational variation, internal selection keeping the machinery of a body in concert, and ecological selection due to the interactions of individuals with their conspecifics, resources, predators, parasites and diseases. AD focuses on these encompassing mechanisms. To get a clean story AD assumes a time scale separation between ecology and evolution. In reality this assumption holds good only rather rarely. The idea is that yet arguments based on it may often lead to outcomes that are fair approximations, provided one applies them selectively and takes a sufficiently gross look at reality. The time scale argument considerably eases the transition from population genetics to the perspective of ecologists, morphologists and taxonomists. AD aims at addressing that larger picture at the cost of being wrong in the details. 1.2. The fitness landscapes of meso-evolution Meso-evolution proceeds by the selective filtering by the ecology of a continual stream of mutations. AD concentrates on the ecological side of this process, as at that end there are clearer a priori mathematical structures. The basic theory assumes clonal reproduction, and only a subset of the results extends to the Mendelian case, for monomorphic populations directly, for polymorphic populations after appropriate modification. When approaching the evolutionary process from ecology, one sees immediately that fitnesses are not given quantities. They depend not only on the traits of individuals but also on their environment. The ecological feedback loop makes that in the monomorphic and clonal cases necessarily the fitnesses of all types present on the ecological time scale are zero. Only the fitnesses of potential mutants can be positive or negative. The signs and sizes of these mutant fitnesses determine the direction and speed of evolution. Evolution corresponds to uphill movement in fitness landscapes that keep changing so as to keep the resident types at zero (see Figure 1). The main insight from the mathematical analysis of this picture has been the discovery of a potential mechanism for adaptive speciation that appears with a certain ubiquity in ecological models. Apart from that, the theory has produced effective tools for analysing special families of eco-evolutionary models. Below it is every time assumed first that individuals reproduce clonally, when relevant followed by a discussion of the Mendelian case. In line with the landscape analogy, zero is referred to as sea level, etc.},

	abstract = {The bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri and juveniles of the squid Euprymna scolopes specifically recognize and respond to one another during the formation of a persistent colonization within the host's nascent light-emitting organ. The resulting fully developed light organ contains brightly luminescing bacteria and has undergone a bacterium-induced program of tissue differentiation, one component of which is a swelling of the epithelial cells that line the symbiont-containing crypts. While the luminescence (lux) genes of symbiotic V. fischeri have been shown to be highly induced within the crypts, the role of these genes in the initiation and persistence of the symbiosis has not been rigorously examined. We have constructed and examined three mutants (luxA, luxI, and luxR), defective in either luciferase enzymatic or regulatory proteins. All three are unable to induce normal luminescence levels in the host and, 2 days after initiating the association, had a three- to fourfold defect in the extent of colonization. Surprisingly, these lux mutants also were unable to induce swelling in the crypt epithelial cells. Complementing, in trans, the defect in light emission restored both normal colonization capability and induction of swelling. We hypothesize that a diminished level of oxygen consumption by a luciferase-deficient symbiotic population is responsible for the reduced fitness of lux mutants in the light organ crypts. This study is the first to show that the capacity for bioluminescence is critical for normal cell-cell interactions between a bacterium and its animal host and presents the first examples of V. fischeri genes that affect normal host tissue development.},

	abstract = {Diverse organisms are associated with obligate microbial mutualists. How such essential symbionts have originated from free-living ancestors is of evolutionary interest. Here we report that, in natural populations of the stinkbug Plautia stali, obligate bacterial mutualists are evolving from environmental bacteria. Of six distinct bacterial lineages associated with insect populations, two are uncultivable with reduced genomes, four are cultivable with non-reduced genomes, one uncultivable symbiont is fixed in temperate populations, and the other uncultivable symbiont coexists with four cultivable symbionts in subtropical populations. Symbiont elimination resulted in host mortality for all symbionts, while re-infection with any of the symbionts restored normal host growth, indicating that all the symbionts are indispensable and almost equivalent functionally. Some aseptic newborns incubated with environmental soils acquired the cultivable symbionts and normal growth was restored, identifying them as environmental Pantoea spp. Our finding uncovers an evolutionary transition from a free-living lifestyle to obligate mutualism that is currently ongoing in nature.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic bacteria infect most eukaryotic species in nearly every biome. Nonetheless, two dilemmas remain unresolved about bacterial-eukaryote mutualisms: how do mutualist phenotypes originate in bacterial lineages and to what degree do mutualists traits drive or hinder bacterial diversification? Here, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the hyperdiverse phylum Proteobacteria to investigate the origins and evolutionary diversification of mutualistic bacterial phenotypes. Our ancestral state reconstructions (ASRs) inferred a range of 34-39 independent origins of mutualist phenotypes in Proteobacteria, revealing the surprising frequency with which host-beneficial traits have evolved in this phylum. We found proteobacterial mutualists to be more often derived from parasitic than from free-living ancestors, consistent with the untested paradigm that bacterial mutualists most often evolve from pathogens. Strikingly, we inferred that mutualists exhibit a negative net diversification rate (speciation minus extinction), which suggests that mutualism evolves primarily via transitions from other states rather than diversification within mutualist taxa. Moreover, our ASRs infer that proteobacterial mutualist lineages exhibit a paucity of reversals to parasitism or to free-living status. This evolutionary conservatism of mutualism is contrary to long-standing theory, which predicts that selection should often favour mutants in microbial mutualist populations that exploit or abandon more slowly evolving eukaryotic hosts.},

We analyzed 10,921 ESTs in 3311 clusters from first- and infective third-stage larva (L1, L3i) of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis and compared the results to Caenorhabditis elegans, a species that has an L3i-like dauer stage. In the comparison of S. stercoralis clusters with stage-specific expression to C elegans homologs expressed in either dauer or nondauer stages, matches between S. stercoralis L1 and C elegans nondauer-expressed genes dominated, suggesting conservation in the repertoire of genes expressed during growth in nutrient-rich conditions. For example, S. stercoralis collagen transcripts were abundant in L1 but not L3i, a pattern consistent with C elegans collagens. Although a greater proportion of S. stercoralis L3i than L1 genes have homologs among the C elegans dauer-specific transcripts, we did not uncover evidence of a robust conserved L3i/dauer 'expression signature.'

	abstract = {The evolution of life on earth has been driven by a small number of major evolutionary transitions. These transitions have been characterized by individuals that could previously replicate inde-pendently, cooperating to form a new, more complex life form. For example, archaea and eubacteria formed eukaryotic cells, and cells formed multicellular organisms. However, not all cooperative groups are en route to major transitions. How can we explain why major evolutionary transitions have or haven't taken place on dif-ferent branches of the tree of life? We break down major transi-tions into two steps: the formation of a cooperative group and the transformation of that group into an integrated entity. We show how these steps require cooperation, division of labor, communi-cation, mutual dependence, and negligible within-group conflict. We find that certain ecological conditions and the ways in which groups form have played recurrent roles in driving multiple tran-sitions. In contrast, we find that other factors have played rela-tively minor roles at many key points, such as within-group kin discrimination and mechanisms to actively repress competition. More generally, by identifying the small number of factors that have driven major transitions, we provide a simpler and more unified description of how life on earth has evolved. cooperation | altruism | signaling | division of labor | conflict T he evolution of life, from simple organic compounds in a primordial soup to the amazing diversity of contemporary organisms, has taken roughly 3.5 billion years. How can we ex-plain the evolution of increasingly complex organisms over this period? A traditional approach has been to consider the suc-cession of taxonomic groups, such as the age of fishes giving rise to the age of amphibians, which gave way to the age of reptiles, and so on. Although this approach has some uses, it is biased toward relatively large plants and animals and lacks a conceptual or predictive framework, in that it suggests we look for different explanations for each succession (1). Twenty years ago, Maynard Smith and Szathm{\'{a}}ry (2) revolu-tionized our understanding of life on earth by showing how the key steps in the evolution of life on earth had been driven by a small number of " major evolutionary transitions. " In each tran-sition, a group of individuals that could previously replicate in-dependently cooperate to form a new, more complex life form. For example, genes cooperated to form genomes, archaea and eubacteria formed eukaryotic cells, and cells cooperated to form multicellular organisms (Table 1). The major transitions approach provides a conceptual framework that facilitates comparison across pivotal moments in the history of life (2, 3). It suggests that the same problem arises at each transition: How are the potentially selfish interests of individuals overcome to form mutually dependent cooperative groups? We can then ask whether there are any similarities across transitions in the answers to this problem. Consequently, rather than look-ing for different explanations for the succession of different taxonomic groups, we could potentially identify a few key factors that have been important again and again at driving increases in organismal complexity. This approach would both unify and sim-plify our understanding of the evolution of life on earth. We define the steps and processes in major transitions and show that the problem of explaining major transitions can be broken down into six questions. We explore what is already known about the factors facilitating transitions, examining the extent to which we can generalize across the different transitions. Ultimately, we are interested in the underlying evolutionary and ecological factors that drive major transitions.},

This was tested alone or together with 4.5{\%} carbon dioxide, the concentration in human and cattle breath. Cattle odours consisted of cow skin emanations and/or carbon dioxide. Cow skin emanations were collected by tying a nylon stocking ('cow sock') around the hind leg of a cow for 12 h. Anopheles gambiae s.s. was consistently highly attracted by human odour, which is consistent with the high degree of anthropophily in this mosquito. Anopheles gambiae s.s. was not attracted by human or cattle equivalent volumes of carbon dioxide and this gas did not enhance the effect of human skin residues. Furthermore, A. gambiae s.s. showed a high degree of aversion to cow odour. When human odour and cow odour were tested together in the same port, mosquitoes were still highly attracted, indicating that whilst cattle odour may deter A. gambiae s.s., these mosquitoes can detect human odour in the presence of cattle odour. It was concluded that carbon dioxide plays a minor role in the host seeking behaviour of A. gambiae s.s., whilst host specific cues such as human skin residues play a major role and very effectively demonstrated anthropophilic behaviour in the laboratory.},

@article{Schmidt2011,
	abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are forming the most wide-spread mycorrhizal relationships on Earth. Mycorrhiza contributes to phosphorous acquisition, water absorption and resistance to diseases. The fungus promotes the absorption of nutrients and water from soil, meanwhile the host plant offers photosynthetic assimilates in exchange, like carbohydrates, as energy source. The plant benefits from the contribution of symbiotic partner only when nutrients are in low concentrations in soil and the root system would not be able to absorb sufficiently the minerals. When the help of mycorrhizal fungi is not necessarily needed, the host plant is making an economy of energy, suppressing the development of fungi in the internal radicular space. In this moment, the nature of relationship turns from symbiotic to parasitic, triggering a series of defensive reactions from the plant. Also, there were several cases reported when the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi negatively influenced the host plant. For example, in adverse environmental conditions, like very high temperatures, instead of determining a higher plant biomass and flowering, the mycorrhiza reduces the growth of the host plant. We conducted a pot experiment with hydroponic culture to examine the effect of arbuscular mycorrhiza on development of French marigold as a host plant. As experimental variants, the phosphorous content in nutrient medium and temperature varied. Plants were artificially infected with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi using a commercial inoculum containing three fungal species, as following: Glomus intraradices, Glomus etunicatum and Glomus claroideum. Colonization intensity and arbuscular richness were checked using root staining with aniline blue and estimation with the Trouvelot method. To observe the differences between plants from the experimental variants, we examined the number of side shoots, flower buds and fully developed flowers, fresh biomass and total leaf area. Results show that adverse climatic conditions, like temperature shock at the beginning of growing period modified the nature of symbiosis. In this case, the physiological parameters were reduced at colonized plants, while usual, constant growing conditions permitted the normal, efficient and beneficial development of symbiosis.},

We provide uninfected mosquitoes with a choice between an uninfected bird and a bird undergoing either an acute or a chronic Plasmodium infection. Mosquito choice is assessed by microsatellite typing of the ingested blood. We show that chronically infected birds attract significantly more vectors than either uninfected or acutely infected birds. Our results suggest that malaria parasites manipulate the behaviour of uninfected vectors to increase their transmission. We discuss the underlying mechanisms driving this behavioural manipulation, as well as the broader implications of these effects for the epidemiology of malaria.},

Skin emanations from 27 human individuals, collected on glass marbles, were tested against ammonia in a dual-choice olfactometer to establish their degrees of attractiveness to anthropophilic Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes. Ammonia was used as a standard odour source because of its proven attractiveness to An. gambiae s.s. Skin emanations from most volunteers attracted significantly more mosquitoes than ammonia. There were clear differences in the attractiveness of skin emanations from different volunteers relative to that of ammonia, as well as in the strength of the trap entry response. Consistent differences were observed when emanations from the three most and the three least attractive volunteers were tested pairwise.

Yet the biomathematical literature of the last 10-20 years reflects the implicit acceptance of a common evolutionary framework, the core idea being that there exists a unique general fitness measure that concisely summarizes the overall time course of potential invasions by initially rare mutant phenotypes. Using such an invasion criterion to characterize fitness implicitly presupposes a scenario in which, during periods o f clear evolutionary change, the rate of evolution is set primarily by the random occurrence (and initial establishment) of favourable mutations. Evolutionarily stable life history strategies (ESSs) may then be regarded as traps for the evolutionary random walk.},

The correlations obtained indicate a similar causal chain of life history variations for free-living and parasitic platyhelminthes.

Parasite-induced behavioural alterations may thus vary between parasite species and depend on each parasite definitive host species. We studied the influence of infection with 2 acanthocephalan parasites (Echinorhynchus truttae and Polymorphus minutus) on the distribution of the amphipod Gammarus pulex in the field. Predator presence or absence and predator species, whether suitable definitive host or dead-end predator, had no effect on the micro-distribution of infected or uninfected G. pulex amphipods. Although neither parasite species seem to influence intermediate host distribution, E. truttae infected G. pulex were still significantly more vulnerable to predation by fish (Cottus gobio), the parasite'sdefinitive hosts. In contrast, G. pulex infected with P. minutus, a bird acanthocephalan, did not suffer from increased predation by C. gobio, a predator unsuitable as host for P. minutus. These results suggest that effects of behavioural changes associated with parasite infections might not be detectable until intermediate hosts actually come in contact with predators. However, parasite-induced changes in host spatial distribution may still be adaptive if they drive hosts into areas of high transmission probabilities. Key},

	abstract = {Understanding the origins and evolutionary trajectories of symbiotic partnerships remains a major challenge. Why are some symbioses lost over evolutionary time whereas others become crucial for survival? Here, we use a quantitative trait reconstruction method to characterize different evolutionary stages in the ancient symbiosis between legumes (Fabaceae) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, asking how labile is symbiosis across different host clades. We find that more than half of the 1,195 extant nodulating legumes analyzed have a high likelihood ({\textgreater}95{\%}) of being in a state of high symbiotic persistence, meaning that they show a continued capacity to form the symbiosis over evolutionary time, even though the partnership has remained facultative and is not obligate. To explore patterns associated with the likelihood of loss and retention of the N2-fixing symbiosis, we tested for correlations between symbiotic persistence and legume distribution, climate, soil and trait data. We found a strong latitudinal effect and demonstrated that low mean annual temperatures are associated with high symbiotic persistence in legumes. Although no significant correlations between soil variables and symbiotic persistence were found, nitrogen and phosphorus leaf contents were positively correlated with legumes in a state of high symbiotic persistence. This pattern suggests that highly demanding nutrient lifestyles are associated with more stable partnerships, potentially because they "lock" the hosts into symbiotic dependency. Quantitative reconstruction methods are emerging as a powerful comparative tool to study broad patterns of symbiont loss and retention across diverse partnerships.},

	abstract = {To explain the evolution of cooperation by natural selection has been a major goal of biologists since Darwin. Cooperators help others at a cost to themselves, while defectors receive the benefits of altruism without providing any help in return. The standard game dynamical formulation is the 'Prisoner's Dilemma', in which two players have a choice between cooperation and defection. In the repeated game, cooperators using direct reciprocity cannot be exploited by defectors, but it is unclear how such cooperators can arise in the first place. In general, defectors are stable against invasion by cooperators. This understanding is based on traditional concepts of evolutionary stability and dynamics in infinite populations. Here we study evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations. We show that a single cooperator using a strategy like 'tit-for-tat' can invade a population of defectors with a probability that corresponds to a net selective advantage. We specify the conditions required for natural selection to favour the emergence of cooperation and define evolutionary stability in finite populations.},

@article{Metz2016,
	abstract = {The fitness concept and perforce the definition of frequency independent fitnesses from population genetics is closely tied to discrete time population models with non-overlapping generations. Evolutionary ecologists generally focus on trait evolution through repeated mutant substitutions in populations with complicated life histories. This goes with using the per capita invasion speed of mutants as their fitness. In this paper we develop a concept of frequency independence that attempts to capture the practical use of the term by ecologists, which although inspired by population genetics rarely fits its strict definition. We propose to call the invasion fitnesses of an eco-evolutionary model frequency independent when the phenotypes can be ranked by competitive strength, measured by who can invade whom. This is equivalent to the absence of weak priority effects, protected dimorphisms and rock--scissor--paper configurations. Our concept differs from that of Heino et al. (TREE 13:367--370, 1998) in that it is based only on the signs of the invasion fitnesses, whereas Heino et al. based their definitions on the structure of the feedback environment, summarising the effect of all direct and indirect interactions between individuals on fitness. As it turns out, according to our new definition an eco-evolutionary model has frequency independent fitnesses if and only if the effect of the feedback environment on the fitness signs can be summarised by a single scalar with monotonic effect. This may be compared with Heino et al.'s concept of trivial frequency dependence defined by the environmental feedback influencing fitness, and not just its sign, in a scalar manner, without any monotonicity restriction. As it turns out, absence of the latter restriction leaves room for rock--scissor--paper configurations. Since in `realistic' (as opposed to toy) models frequency independence is exceedingly rare, we also define a concept of weak frequency dependence, which can be interpreted intuitively as almost frequency independence, and analyse in which sense and to what extent the restrictions on the potential model outcomes of the frequency independent case stay intact for models with weak frequency dependence.},

	abstract = {A great diversity of plants and fungi engage in mycorrhizal associations. In natural habitats, and in an ecologically meaningful time span, these associations have evolved to improve the fitness of both plant and fungal symbionts. In systems managed by humans, mycorrhizal associations often improve plant productivity, but this is not always the case. Mycorrhizal fungi might be considered to be parasitic on plants when net cost of the symbiosis exceeds net benefits. Parasitism can be developmentally induced, environmentally induced, or possibly genotypically induced. Morphological, phenological, and physiological characteristics of the symbionts influence the functioning of mycorrhizas at an individual scale. Biotic and abiotic factors at the rhizosphere, community, and ecosystem scales further mediate mycorrhizal functioning. Despite the complexity of mycorrhizal associations, it might be possible to construct predictive models of mycorrhizal functioning. These models will need to incorporate variables and parameters that account for differences in plant responses to, and control of, mycorrhizal fungi, and differences in fungal effects on, and responses to, the plant. Developing and testing quantitative models of mycorrhizal functioning in the real world requires creative experimental manipulations and measurements. This work will be facilitated by recent advances in molecular and biochemical techniques. A greater understanding of how mycorrhizas function in complex natural systems is a prerequisite to managing them in agriculture, forestry, and restoration.},

@article{Anderson2007,
	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that mutualisms often have variable outcomes in space and time. In particular, the outcomes may be dependent on the density of the partners with unimodal or saturating outcomes providing stability to the mutualism. We examine density-dependent outcomes of an obligate, species-specific mutualism between a South African carnivorous plant (Roridula dentata) and a hemipteran (Pameridea) that facilitates prey digestion, but also sucks plant sap. Plants occur in sandy, leached, nitrogen-poor soils and have no digestive enzymes to digest prey. Instead they rely on obligately dependent hemipterans to supply nitrogen by digesting prey for them and defecating on their leaves. We documented the densities of Pameridea on Roridula in the field. In the greenhouse, we manipulated the hemipteran densities on Roridula and measured the mean relative growth rates of plants with differing hemipteran densities. Plants exhibited a unimodal response to the density of their mutualist partners. Those with no hemipterans had negative growth rates, suggesting that hemipterans are important in facilitating nitrogen absorption. Plants with intermediate hemipteran densities had positive growth rates but growth rates were negative under very high hemipteran densities. Our research provides support for variable and unimodal outcomes in mutualism. Unimodal outcomes may be particularly important in obligate mutualisms and this is one of the few studied outside of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms. In this system, extrinsic factors such as other predators may affect the mutualism by altering the numbers of hemipterans.},

Indeed, as the highly theoretical concepts of quasispecies and error catastrophe gained mainstream attention over the last thirty years, notions of viral populations and viral evolution became almost inseparable for many virologists. In contrast, a large body of theoretical work on the evolution of virulence has yet to gain traction in the virology community. Our purpose here is to offer a brief introduction to virulence theory, explain some of its strengths and weaknesses, and suggest how theory might be united with empiric data.

@article{Geier1999,
	abstract = {Both the concentration and the fine-scale plume structure of host odours influence the upwind flight of female mosquitoes Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) in a wind tunnel. The attractive effects of carbon dioxide, human skin odour and l-(+)-lactic acid were tested in homogeneous, turbulent and filamentous odour plumes. With carbon dioxide, the percentage of upwind-flying mosquitoes increased with the increasing fluctuations in concentration that occur in turbulent and filamentous plumes. In homogeneous plumes, an initial activation effect was observed, but sustained upwind flights were less frequent than in the other plumes. The opposite was found with plumes of human skin odour: the highest number of mosquitoes flew upwind in the homogeneous plume, whereas in turbulent or filamentous plumes their numbers were significantly lower. Regardless of plume type, the percentage of upwind-flying mosquitoes increased with increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide and of skin odour. With l-(+)-lactic acid, the dose-response characteristics were not consistent, and the relative effects of different plume types upon upwind flights differed within different ranges of concentration. Even maximum reactions to this compound were modest compared with those to carbon dioxide or to skin odour. Our findings demonstrate (1) that mosquitoes are able to orient upwind under continuous odour stimulation and (2) that upwind flight is dependent upon plume structure in different ways for different host odour components.},

	abstract = {We present a general framework for modelling adaptive trait dynamics in which we integrate various concepts and techniques from modern ESS-theory. The concept of evolutionarily singular strategies is introduced as a generalization of the ESS-concept. We give a full classification of the singular strategies in terms of ESS-stability, convergence stability, the ability of the singular strategy to invade other populations if initially rare itself, and the possibility of protected dimorphisms occurring within the singular strategy's neighbourhood. Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching. Modelling the adaptive growth and branching of the evolutionary tree can thus be considered as a major application of the framework. A haploid version of Levene's `soft selection' model is developed as a specific example to demonstrate evolutionary dynamics and branching in monomorphic and polymorphic populations.},

@article{Dabire2014,
	abstract = {The swarming behaviour of natural populations of Anopheles arabiensis was investigated by conducting transect surveys on 10 consecutive days, around dusk, from March to April and from September to October 2012 in Dioulassoba, a district of Bobo-Dioulasso city in Burkina Faso (West Africa). Swarms were observed outside, around identified larval breeding sites on the banks of the Houet River, as well as in the open-air courtyards found at the centre of many homes in the region. Swarms were found to occur in open sunlit spaces, mostly located above physical or visual cues somehow visually distinct from the surrounding area. Overall 67 and 78 swarms were observed, respectively, during the dry season (March-April) and the rainy season (September-October) of 2012, between 1.5 and 4.5. m above the ground at the centre. 964 mosquitoes were collected and analysed from dry season swarms, of which most were male, and all were An. arabiensis, as were the few resting mosquitoes collected indoors. Larvae collected from breeding sites found on the banks of the Houet River mostly consisted of An. arabiensis and only a minority of Anopheles coluzzii (formerly identified as An. gambiae M form). Of 1694 mosquitoes analysed from 78 swarms in the rainy season collections, a few An. gambiae (formerly known as An. gambiae S form) males were identified, and the remainders were An. arabiensis. The majority of larvae collected during the wet season from the same breeding sites were identified as An. arabiensis followed by An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. The same pattern of species composition was observed in resting mosquitoes, though the proportion of An. arabiensis was less overwhelming. These data support the conclusion that An. arabiensis is the most prevalent species in this area, though the difference in species composition when using different population sampling techniques is noteworthy. Further studies are required for more detailed investigations of male dispersal, feeding behaviour and mating patterns in this urban setting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Abstract Virulence is an evolutionary paradox because parasites never benefit from their host's death. The adaptive explanation of virulence is classically based upon the existence of physiological constraints that create a trade-off between parasites' epidemiological traits (virulence, transmissibility, and clearance). Here we develop an epidemiological model where infections are dynamic processes and we demonstrate how these dynamics generate a trade-off between emerging epidemiological parameters. We then study how host's immune strength modifies this trade-off and hence influences virulence evolution. We found that in acute infections, where parasites are engaged in a race with immune cells, immunity restrains more the duration of the infection than its intensity. As a consequence parasites evolve to provoke more virulent but shorter infections in strongly immunized hosts.},

Many factors may be responsible for this evolutionary change in their physiology. The present work aimed to clarify the host factors in this problem. Albino mice were the laboratory animals used in this work. Non-pathogenic strains of FLA were isolated from ear, nose and pharyngeal swabs and from contact lenses of patients attending out patient clinics in Benha University Hospitals. Isolation was done by cultivation of non-nutrient agar at 37 {\&} 43 degrees C and identification was made by flagellation test. The degree of pathogenicity of isolated strains was assessed by using animal pathogenicity test. Endoxan (0.7 mg/kg) and Prednisolone (2 mg/kg) were used for 15 days orally to suppress the immunity of clean mice before their inoculation intranasally with the isolated strains. All groups were observed for 3 weeks post-infection. Mortality rates recorded were higher in Endoxan or Prednisolone treated and Naegleria infected groups A I {\&} B I (20 {\&} 15{\%} respectively) than Endoxan or Prednisolone treated and acanthamoeba infected groups A II {\&} B II (10{\%}) and drug control (10{\%}).

Drug control groups showed negligible changes. Great attention must be paid to reveal the presence of FLA before using immunosuppressive drugs in human cases.},

	abstract = {The responses of Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae) to odors from male and female axillary sweat incubated with human axilla bacteria were recorded in a dual-choice olfactometer. Staphylococcus epidermidis was selected for its low odor-producing pattern, Corynebacterium jeikeium for its strong Nalpha-acylglutamine aminoacylase activity liberating carboxylic acids including (R)/(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid (HMHA) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus for its capacity to liberate sulfur-containing compounds including (R/S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (MSH). Anopheles gambiae behavioral responses were evaluated under (i) its responsiveness to take off and undertake sustained upwind flight and (ii) its discriminating capacity between the two olfactometer arms bearing a test odor in either one or both arms. Experiments were conducted in the presence of carbon dioxide pulses as a behavioral sensitizer. Anopheles gambiae clearly discriminated for the olfactometer arm conveying odor generated by incubating any of the three bacteria species with either male or female sweat. Whereas An. gambiae did not discriminate between male and female sterile sweat samples in the olfactometer, the mosquito consistently showed a preference for male sweat over female sweat incubated with the same bacterium, independent of the species used as inoculum. Sweat incubated with C. jeikeium rendered mosquitoes particularly responsive and this substrate elicited the strongest preference for male over female sweat. Tested on their own, neither HMHA nor MSH elicited a clear discriminating response but did affect mosquito responsiveness. These findings serve as a basis for further research on the odor-mediated anthropophilic host-seeking behavior of An. gambiae.},

@article{Marco2009,
	abstract = {Despite the importance of mutualism as a key ecological process, its persistence in nature is difficult to explain since the existence of exploitative, "cheating" partners that could erode the interaction is common. By analogy with the proposed policing strategy stabilizing intraspecific cooperation, host sanctions against non-N2 fixing, cheating symbionts have been proposed as a force stabilizing mutualism in legume-Rhizobium symbiosis. Following this proposal, penalizations would include decreased nodular rhizobial viability and/or early nodule senescence in nodules occupied by cheating rhizobia. In this work, we analyse the stability of Rhizobium-legume symbiosis when non-fixing, cheating strains are present, using an experimental and modelling approach. We used split-root experiments with soybean plants inoculated with two rhizobial strains, a cooperative, normal N2 fixing strain and an isogenic non-fixing, "perfect" cheating mutant derivative that lacks nitrogenase activity but has the same nodulation abilities inoculated to split-root plants. We found no experimental evidence of functioning plant host sanctions to cheater rhizobia based on nodular rhizobia viability and nodule senescence and maturity molecular markers. Based on these experiments, we developed a population dynamic model with and without the inclusion of plant host sanctions. We show that plant populations persist in spite of the presence of cheating rhizobia without the need of incorporating any sanction against the cheater populations in the model, under the realistic assumption that plants can at least get some amount of fixed N2 from the effectively mutualistic rhizobia occupying some nodules. Inclusion of plant sanctions leads to the unrealistic effect of ultimate extinction of cheater strains in soil. Our simulation results are in agreement with increasing experimental evidence and theoretical work showing that mutualisms can persist in presence of cheating partners. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we explore the evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite associations in which individual hosts can be coinfected with many different parasite strains. (We take coinfection to mean that each strain transmits at a rate unaffected by the presence of others in the same host.) This study thus represents the opposite extreme to our earlier work on superinfection in which there is a dominance hierarchy such that only the most virulent strain present in a host is transmitted. For highly diverse populations of parasite strains, we find that such coinfection leads to selection for strains whose virulence-levels lie in a relatively narrow band close to the maximum consistent with the parasite's basic preproductive ratio, R0, exceeding unity.},

In our work we have demonstrated that reproduction of U. cyprinae can be completed out of its host. More than 50{\%} of turbellarians isolated from mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) secreted and cemented a cocoon to the well bottom during the first 72 h of incubation in seawater (34{\&} salinity) at 14 C. Oviposition started at days 1--18 (average 4.8 days) and occurred in most cases inside the protective cocoon. Each Urastoma laid an average of 2.9 egg capsules (range 1--10) and 3.9 embryos were developed inside each egg capsule (range 1--11). Hatching started at days 20--43 (average 24 days). An average of 12.8 juvenile forms (range 1--64) escaped from the cocoon after hatching. The free-swimming juveniles showed a positive phototactic response and survived about a month after hatching. On the basis of our results, we propose a life cycle for U. cyprinae involving a sexual maturation parasitic period in the bivalve gills and a reproduction period including cocoon secretion, egg laying, and hatching that is entirely completed in the external environment.},

In this review, we describe the B. cereus sensu lato living in a world on its own; all B. cereus sensu lato can grow saprophytically under nutrient-rich conditions, which are only occasionally found in the environment, except where nutrients are actively collected. As such, members of the B. cereus group have recently been discovered as common inhabitants of the invertebrate gut. We speculate that all members disclose symbiotic relationships with appropriate invertebrate hosts and only occasionally enter a pathogenic life cycle in which the individual species infects suitable hosts and multiplies almost unrestrained.},

	abstract = {Mutualistic symbioses are considered to evolve from parasitic relationships. Vertical transmission, defined as the direct transfer of infection from a parent organism to its progeny, has been suggested as a key factor causing reduction of symbiont virulence and evolution of mutualism. On the other hand, there are several mutualistic associations without vertical transmission, such as those between plants and mycorrhizal fungi, legumes and rhizobia, and some corals and dinoflagellates. It is expected that all mutualisms evolve perfect vertical transmission if the relationship is really mutualistic, because hosts may fail to acquire symbionts if they do not transmit the symbionts by vertical transmission. We have developed a mathematical model to clarify the conditions under which mutualistic symbiosis without vertical transmission should evolve. The evolution may occur when and only when (i) vertical transmission involves some costs in the host, (ii) the symbiont suffers direct negative effects if it exploits the host too intensively, (iii) the host establishes the ability to make use of waste products from the symbiont, and (iv) the mechanism of vertical transmission is controlled by the host. We also clarify the conditions under which mutualistic symbiosis with vertical transmission evolves.},

Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris are opportunistic pathogens causing infections of the central nervous system, lungs, sinuses and skin, mostly in immunocompromised humans. Balamuthia is also associated with disease in immunocompetent children, and Acanthamoeba spp. cause a sight-threatening infection, Acanthamoeba keratitis, mostly in contact-lens wearers. Of more than 30 species of Naegleria, only one species, N. fowleri, causes an acute and fulminating meningoencephalitis in immunocompetent children and young adults. In addition to human infections, Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia and Naegleria can cause central nervous system infections in animals. Because only one human case of encephalitis caused by Sappinia diploidea is known, generalizations about the organism as an agent of disease are premature. In this review we summarize what is known of these free-living amoebae, focusing on their biology, ecology, types of disease and diagnostic methods. We also discuss the clinical profiles, mechanisms of pathogenesis, pathophysiology, immunology, antimicrobial sensitivity and molecular characteristics of these amoebae.},

Recently there has been considerable interest in linking within- and between-host levels of disease dynamics in the study of pathogen evolution. Here we review the extent to which these nested models have increased our understanding of pathogen evolution. We suggest that, although such models have been useful for determining the nature of tradeoffs between epidemiological parameters and for evaluating the consequences of conflicting selection pressures at different scales, the vast majority of previous results could likely have been obtained without the use of nested models per se. Nevertheless, these models have proven very useful through their highlighting of the importance of within-host disease dynamics on pathogen evolution. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Fluctuating selection driven by coevolution between hosts and parasites is important for the generation of host and parasite diversity across space and time. Theory has focused primarily on infection genetics, with highly specific `matching-allele' frameworks more likely to generate fluctuating selection dynamics (FSD) than `gene-for-gene' (generalist--specialist) frameworks. However, the environment, ecological feedbacks and life-history characteristics may all play a role in determining when FSD occurs. Here, we develop eco-evolutionary models with explicit ecological dynamics to explore the ecological, epidemiological and host life-history drivers of FSD. Our key result is to demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that specificity between hosts and parasites is not required to generate FSD. Furthermore, highly specific host--parasite interactions produce unstable, less robust stochastic fluctuations in contrast to interactions that lack specificity altogether or those that vary from generalist to specialist, which produce predictable limit cycles. Given the ubiquity of ecological feedbacks and the variation in the nature of specificity in host--parasite interactions, our work emphasizes the underestimated potential for host--parasite coevolution to generate fluctuating selection.},

Here we present a general model that predicts three key factors will be important in mutualism evolution: (i) high benefit to cost ratio, (ii) high within-species relatedness and (iii) high between-species fidelity. These factors operate by moderating three types of feedback benefit from mutualism: cooperator association, partner-fidelity feedback and partner choice. In defining the relationship between these processes, our model also allows an assessment of their relative importance. Importantly, the model suggests that phenotypic feedbacks (partner-fidelity feedback, partner choice) are a more important explanation for between-species cooperation than the development of genetic correlations among species (cooperator association). We explain the relationship of our model to existing theories and discuss the empirical evidence for our predictions.},

	abstract = {Merging the field of epidemiology with those of evolutionary and behavioural ecology can generate considerable fundamental knowledge, as well as help to guide public health policies. An attempt is made here to integrate these disciplines by focusing on parasitic manipulation in vector-borne diseases. Parasitic manipulation is a fascinating strategy of transmission which occurs when a parasite alters phenotypic trait(s) of its host in a way that enhances its probability of transmission. Vector-borne parasites are responsible for many of the most harmful diseases affecting humans, and thus represent public health priority. It has been shown for several decades that viruses, bacteria and protozoa can alter important features of their arthropod vector and vertebrate host in a way that increases their probability of transmission. Here, we review these changes, including, the feeding behaviour, survival and immune system of the vector, as well as attraction, defensive behaviour, blood characterictics and immune system of the vertebrate host. Based on the classic measure of vector-borne disease transmission R0, additional changes, such as, vertebrate host choice by infected vectors or parasite development duration in the vector are expected. Reported or expected phenotypic changes are discussed in terms of costs and benefits to the parasite, its vector, and the vertebrate host. Introducing the parasitic manipulation concept into vector-borne diseases clearly highlights fruitful avenues not only for fundamental research, but also for developing strategies for disease control. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine a host-parasite model with an additional predator and show that the predator changes the evolutionary behaviour of the host. We find that the hosts maximize their levels of resistance at intermediate predation rates, where the cost of infection and the risk of exposure to disease are both high. We show that this effect is heightened when parasites are highly virulent and when there is strong selective predation. We also show that the potential for evolutionary branching increases with the predation rate for regions where the susceptible and infected hosts coexist with the predator. Hence, our results reveal that there are considerable impacts of adding predators to a population.},

The first approach is independent of any specific ecological model and based on curvature properties of the fitness landscape as a function of the dimension of the trait space. This approach indeed suggests a positive correlation between complexity and diversity. An assumption made in this first approach is that the potential for any pair of traits to interact in their effect on fitness is independent of the dimension of the trait space. In the second approach, we circumvent making this assumption by analyzing the evolutionary dynamics in an explicit consumer-resource model in which the shape of the fitness landscape emerges from the underlying mechanistic ecological model. In this model, consumers are characterized by several quantitative traits and feed on a multidimensional resource distribution. The consumer's feeding efficiency on the resource is determined by the match between consumer phenotype and resource item. This analysis supports a positive correlation between the complexity of the evolving consumer species and its potential to diversify with the additional insight that also increasing resource complexity facilitates diversification.},

@article{Dobson1988,
	abstract = {The ability of parasites to change the behavior of infected hosts has been documented and reviewed by a number of different authors (Holmes and Bethel, 1972; Moore, 1984a). This review attempts to quantify the population dynamic consequences of this behavior by developing simple mathematical models for the most frequently recorded of such parasite life cycles. Although changes in the behavior of infected hosts do occur for pathogens with direct life cycles, they are most commonly recorded in the intermediate hosts of parasites with complex life cycles. All the changes in host behavior serve to increase rates of transmission of the parasites between hosts. In the simplest case the changes in behavior increase rates of contact between infected and susceptible conspecific hosts, whereas in the more complex cases fairly sophisticated manipulations of the host's behavioral repertory are achieved. Three topics are dealt with in some detail: (1) the behavior of the insect vectors of such diseases as malaria and trypanosomiasis; (2) the intermediate hosts of helminths whose behavior is affected in such a way as to make them more susceptible to predation by the definitive host in the life cycle; and (3) the behavior and fecundity of molluscs infected with asexually reproducing parasitic flatworms. In each case an expression is derived for R0, the basic reproductive rate of the parasite when first introduced into the population. This is used to determine the threshold numbers of definitive and intermediate hosts needed to maintain a population of the pathogen. In all cases, parasite-induced changes in host behavior tend to increase R0 and reduce the threshold number of hosts required to sustain the infection. The population dynamics of the interaction between parasites and their hosts are then explored using phase plane analyses. This suggests that both the parasite and intermediate host populations may show oscillatory patterns of abundance. When the density of the latter is low, parasite-induced changes in host behavior increase this tendency to oscillate. When intermediate host population densities are high, parasite population density is determined principally by interactions between the parasites and their definitive hosts, and changes in the behavior of intermediate hosts are less important in determining parasite density.

While most foodborne bacterial pathogens are considered to be relatively robust organisms, as a consequence of the necessity to survive the inimical conditions imposed by food processing and preservation, Campylobacter species have uniquely fastidious growth requirements and an unusual sensitivity to environmental stress. Campylobacters also lack many of the well characterised adaptive responses that can be collerated with resistance to stress in other bacteria. The aim of this review is to outline the unusual physiology of campylobacters (C. jejuni and C. coli) and to describe how this influences their role as foodborne pathogens. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Presumably, the corresponding enzymes were lost in adaptation to parasitism. Here we compare the predicted core metabolic graphs of obligate endoparasites and non-parasites (free living organisms and facultative parasites) in order to analyze how the parasites' metabolic networks shrunk in the course of evolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Core metabolic graphs comprising biochemical reactions present in the presumed ancestor of parasites and non-parasites were reconstructed from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. While the parasites' networks had fewer nodes (metabolites) and edges (reactions), other parameters such as average connectivity, network diameter and number of isolated edges were similar in parasites and non-parasites. The parasites' networks contained a higher percentage of ATP-consuming reactions and a lower percentage of NAD-requiring reactions. Control networks, shrunk to the size of the parasites' by random deletion of edges, were scale-free but exhibited smaller diameters and more isolated edges.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The parasites' networks were smaller than those of the non-parasites regarding number of nodes or edges, but not regarding network diameters. Network integrity but not scale-freeness has acted as a selective principle during the evolutionary reduction of parasite metabolism. ATP-requiring reactions in particular have been retained in the parasites' core metabolism while NADH- or NADPH-requiring reactions were lost preferentially.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The question whether Plasmodium falciparum infection affects the fitness of mosquito vectors remains open. A hurdle for resolving this question is the lack of appropriate control, non-infected mosquitoes that can be compared to the infected ones. It was shown recently that heating P. falciparum gametocyte-infected blood before feeding by malaria vectors inhibits the infection. Therefore, the same source of gametocyte-infected blood could be divided in two parts, one heated, serving as the control, the other unheated, allowing the comparison of infected and uninfected mosquitoes which fed on exactly the same blood otherwise. However, before using this method for characterizing the cost of infection to mosquitoes, it is necessary to establish whether feeding on previously heated blood affects the survival and fecundity of mosquito females. METHODS: Anopheles gambiae M molecular form females were exposed to heated versus non-heated, parasite-free human blood to mimic blood meal on non-infectious versus infectious gametocyte-containing blood. Life history traits of mosquito females fed on blood that was heat-treated or not were then compared. RESULTS: The results reveal that heat treatment of the blood did not affect the survival and fecundity of mosquito females. Consistently, blood heat treatment did not affect the quantity of blood ingested. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that heat inactivation of gametocyte-infected blood will only inhibit mosquito infection and that this method is suitable for quantifying the fitness cost incurred by mosquitoes upon infection by P. falciparum.},

Although much research has focused on identifying the ecological factors that favor the stability of communities rich in mutualists, much less has been devoted to understanding the role played by historical and contemporary evolution. Here we develop mathematical models and computer simulations of coevolving mutualistic communities that allow us to explore the importance of coevolution in stabilizing communities against anthropogenic disturbance. Our results demonstrate that communities with a long history of coevolution are substantially more robust to disturbance, losing individual species and interactions at lower rates. In addition, our results identify a novel phenomenon---coevolutionary rescue---that mitigates the impacts of ongoing anthropogenic disturbance by rewiring the network structure of the community in...},

We then distinguish between two aspects ofniche construction--environment alteration and subsequent evolution in response to constructed environments--equating the first of these with "ecosystem engineering." We describe some of the ecological and evolutionary impacts on ecosystems of niche construction, ecosystem engineering and ecological inheritance, and illustrate how these processes trigger ecological and evolutionary feedbacks and leave detectable ecological signatures that are open to investigation. FIinally, we provide a practical guide to how NCT could be deployed by ecologists and evolutionary biologists to aeplore ecoeoolutionay dynamics. We suggest that, by highlighting the ecological and evolutionay ramifications of changes that organisms bring about in ecosystems, NCT helps link ecosystem ecology to evolutionary biology, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of how ecosystems change over time.},

	abstract = {Lichens are widespread symbioses and play important roles in many terrestrial ecosystems. The genetic structure of lichens is the result of the association between fungal and algal populations constituting the lichen thallus. Using eight fungus- and seven alga-specific highly variable microsatellite markers on within-population spatial genetic data from 62 replicate populations across Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, we investigated the contributions of vertical and horizontal transmission of the photobiont to the genetic structure of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria. Based on pairwise comparisons of multilocus genotypes defined separately for the mycobiont and for the photobiont, we inferred the transmission mode of the photobiont and the relative contribution of somatic mutation and recombination. After constraining the analysis of one symbiont to pairs of individuals with genetically identical symbiotic partners, we found that 77{\%} of fungal and 70{\%} of algal pairs were represented by clones. Thus, the predominant dispersal mode was by means of symbiotic vegetative propagules (vertical transmission), which dispersed fungal and algal clones co-dependently over a short distance, thus shaping the spatial genetic structure up to distances of 20m. Evidence for somatic mutation generating genetic diversity was found in both symbionts, accounting for 30{\%} of pairwise comparisons in the alga and 15{\%} in the fungus. While the alga did not show statistically significant evidence of recombination, recombination accounted for 7.7{\%} of fungal pairs with identical algae. This implies that, even in a mostly vegetatively reproducing species, horizontal transmission plays a role in shaping the symbiotic association, as shown in many coral and other symbioses in nature.},

The trade-off hypothesis states that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of parasite transmission; however, since the 1990s, this hypothesis has been increasingly challenged. We discuss the history of the study of virulence evolution and the development of theories towards the trade-off hypothesis in order to illustrate the context of the debate. We investigate the arguments raised against the trade-off hypothesis and argue that trade-offs exist, but may not be of the simple form that is usually assumed, involving other mechanisms (and life-history traits) than those originally considered. Many processes such as pathogen adaptation to within-host competition, interactions with the immune system and shifting transmission routes, will all be interrelated making sweeping evolutionary predictions harder to obtain. We argue that this is the heart of the current debate in the field and while species-specific models may be better predictive tools, the trade-off hypothesis and its basic extensions are necessary to assess the qualitative impacts of virulence management strategies.},

	abstract = {Generalist consumers commonly coexist in many ecosystems. Yet, eco-evolutionary theory poses a problem with this observation: generalist consumers (usually) cannot coexist stably. To provide a solution to this theory-observation dissonance, we analyzed a simple eco-evolutionary consumer resource model. We modeled consumption of two nutritional-ly interactive resources by species which evolve their resource encounter rates subject to a tradeoff. As shown previously, consumers can ecologically coexist through tradeoffs in re-source encounter rates; however, this coexistence is evolution-ary unstable. Here, we find that nutritional interactions be-tween resources and the shape of acquisition tradeoffs produce very similar evolutionary outcomes in isolation. Specifically, they produce evolutionarily stable communities composed ei-ther of two specialists (concave acquisition tradeoff or antag-onistic nutrition) or a single generalist (convex acquisition tradeoff or complementary nutrition). Thus, the generalist-coexistence problem remains. However, the combination of nonlinear resource acquisition tradeoffs with nonlinear re-source nutritional relationships creates selection forces that can push and pull against each other. Ultimately, this push-pull dynamic can stabilize the coexistence of two competing generalist consumers---but only when we coupled a convex acquisition tradeoff with antagonistic nutrition. Thus, our mod-el here offers some resolution to the generalist-coexistence problem in eco-evolutionary, consumer-resource theory.},

	abstract = {Mutualisms are of central importance in biological systems. Despite growing attention in recent years, however, few conceptual themes have yet to be identified that span mutualisms differing in natural history. Here I examine the idea that the ecology and evolution of mutualisms are shaped by diverse costs, not only by the benefits they confer. This concept helps link mutualism to antagonisms such as herbivory, predation, and parasitism, interactions defined largely by the existence of costs. I first briefly review the range of costs associated with mutualisms, then describe how one cost, the consumption of seeds by pollinator offspring, was quantified for one fig/pollinator mutualism. I compare this cost to published values for other fig/pollinator mutualisms and for other kinds of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms, notably the yucca/yucca moth interaction. I then discuss four issues that fundamentally complicate comparative studies of the cost of mutualism: problems of knowing how to measure the magnitude of any one cost accurately; problems associated with using average estimates in the absence of data on sources of variation; complications arising from the complex correlates of costs, such as functional linkages between costs and benefits; and problems that arise from considering the cost of mutualism as a unilateral issue in what is fundamentally a reciprocal interaction. The rich diversity of as-yet unaddressed questions surrounding the costs of mutualism may best be investigated via detailed studies of individual interactions.

@article{Perkins2014,
	abstract = {Abstract : Malaria has been one of the most important diseases of humans throughout history and continues to be a major public health concern. The 5 species of Plasmodium that cause the disease in humans are part of the order Haemosporida, a diverse group of parasites that all have heteroxenous life cycles, alternating between a vertebrate host and a free-flying, blood-feeding dipteran vector. Traditionally, the identification and taxonomy of these parasites relied heavily on life-history characteristics, basic morphological features, and the host species infected. However, molecular approaches to resolving the phylogeny of the group have sometimes challenged many of these traditional hypotheses. One of the greatest debates has concerned the origin of the most virulent of the human-infecting parasites, Plasmodium falciparum , with early results suggesting a close relationship with an avian parasite. Subsequent phylogenetic studies placed it firmly within the mammalian clade instead, but the avian origin hypothesis has been revived with recent genome-based analyses. The rooting of the tree of Haemosporida has also been inconsistent, and the various topologies that result certainly affect our interpretation of the history of the group. There is clearly a pressing need to obtain a much more complete degree of taxon sampling of haemosporidians, as well as a greater number of characters before confidence can be placed in any hypothesis regarding the evolutionary history of the order. There are numerous challenges moving forward, particularly for generating complete genome sequences of avian and saurian parasites.},

	abstract = {1. To improve our understanding of the relationship between the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) and the phytotelma community inhabiting its leaves we built an exploratory, mechanistic model based on stochiometric constraints on carbon and nitrogen associated with prey decomposition. 2. Our theoretical results suggest that the phytotelma community is acting as a mineralizing system producing nitrogen for the plant. This is confirmed by data collected in the field and in the literature, that show the amount of nitrogen produced by the decomposition of prey is sufficiently high to be considered as a major source of nitrogen for the plant. 3. In our model, nitrogen yield is higher if the phytotelma community is restricted to bacteria alone than when the full food web is present. Nitrogen availability is negatively affected by bacterivores (rotifers and protozoa mostly) and positively affected by a cascading effect of mosquito larvae. 4. When sedimentation rate is high, mosquitoes have a global positive effect on nitrogen production because they indirectly reduce the amount of nitrogen lost through sedimentation more than they export nitrogen through pupation. On the other hand, when sedimentation rate is low there is a hump-shaped relationship between the uptake rate of bacterivores by mosquito larvae and the nitrogen yield in the plant. 5. We conclude that plant-bacteria and plant-mosquito interactions are predominantly mutualistic, whereas plant-bacterivore interactions are predominantly parasitic. Our work also illustrates how ecosystem properties (here nitrogen production by the phytotelma community) can be understood as a function of trophic complexity and can be seen as a product of selection at the scale of a community.},

Protection is often achieved through production of inhibiting toxins, which is not surprising given that toxin production mediates competition in many environments. Classical models of macroecological interactions, however, demonstrate that interspecific competition can be less direct, and recent research indicates that symbiont-protection can be mediated through exploitation of limiting resources, and through activation of host immune mechanisms that then suppress natural enemies. Available data, though limited, suggest that effects of symbionts on vectored pathogens and parasites, as compared to those that are host-targeted, are more likely to result from symbiont activation of the host immune system. We discuss these different mechanisms in light of their potential impact on the evolution of host physiological processes.},

Here, we discuss the potential coevolutionary interdependence of the strength and specificity of symbiotic interactions with the complexity and productivity of their environment. We predict that interactions become less beneficial with increasing environmental quality and that the association of productivity with symbiont specificity depends on the relative strengths of tradeoffs between host range and other life-history parameters. However, as biotic complexity increases, pathogen specificity is predicted to decline, whereas mutualist specificity will increase. Testing these predictions on a geographical scale would contribute significantly to the predictive science of coevolution, and to our ability to manage biological interactions embedded in increasingly fragmented landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Yamamura1993,
	abstract = {Using an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model, it is shown that vertical transmission, defined as the direct transfer of infection from a parent host to its progeny, is an important factor which can urge reduction of parasite virulence. Evolution of the vertical transmission rate from both points of view, the parasite and the host, is analyzed. There is a critical level on the rate, below which an evolutionary conflict arises (the parasite would want to increase the rate while the host would not), and above which both sides would correspond to increase the rate. Therefore, once the parasite dominates the evolutionary race so as to overcome the critical level, the one-way evolution begins toward a highly mutualistic relationship with a high vertical transmission rate. The changes in other parameters may decrease the critical level, initiating the one-way evolution. However, changes in traits, probably developed through long interrelationship in parasitism, do not necessarily induce the evolution of mutualism. Establishment of the ability to make use of metabolic and digestive wastes from the partner certainly facilitates the evolution of mutualism, while improvements in reproductive efficiency of the parasites and reduction of negative effects from exploitation in hosts contrarily disturb mutualism. Finally, available data are discussed in the light of predictions of the model.},

To assist drug development through the identification of essential genes and pathways, we have measured competitive growth rates in mice of 2,578 barcoded Plasmodium berghei knockout mutants, representing {\textgreater}50{\%} of the genome, and created a phenotype database. At a single stage of its complex life cycle, P. berghei requires two-thirds of genes for optimal growth, the highest proportion reported from any organism and a probable consequence of functional optimization necessitated by genomic reductions during the evolution of parasitism. In contrast, extreme functional redundancy has evolved among expanded gene families operating at the parasite-host interface. The level of genetic redundancy in a single-celled organism may thus reflect the degree of environmental variation it experiences. In the case of Plasmodium parasites, this helps rationalize both the relative successes of drugs and the greater difficulty of making an effective vaccine.},

In only one study a dose response effect (increasing trend with dose) for infection was observed. High susceptibility to infection with C. jejuni was found in a joint analysis of outbreaks and challenge studies. For that reason four outbreaks, associated with raw milk consumption, were also included in the present study.The high doses used for inoculation did not cause all infected subjects to develop acute enteric symptoms. The observed outcomes are consistent with a dose response effect for acute symptoms among infected subjects: a conditional illness dose response relation. Nonhuman primates and human volunteers did not appear to have different susceptibilities for developing enteric symptoms, but exposure in outbreaks (raw milk) did lead to a higher probability of symptomatic campylobacteriosis.},

Here, we argue that a radically different stance is needed, based on evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) arguments that take account of the 'dimension of the environmental feedback loop.' The R0 maximisation paradigm requires this feedback loop to be one-dimensional, which notably excludes pathogen diversification. By contrast, almost all realistic ecological ingredients of host-pathogen interactions (density-dependent mortality, multiple infections, limited cross-immunity, multiple transmission routes, host heterogeneity, and spatial structure) will lead to multidimensional feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Interspecific mutualisms have been playing a central role in the functioning of all ecosystems since the early history of life. Yet the theory of coevolution of mutualists is virtually nonexistent, by contrast with well-developed coevolutionary theories of competition, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. This has prevented resolution of a basic puzzle posed by mutualisms: their persistence in spite of apparent evolutionary instability. The selective advantage of 'cheating', that is, reaping mutualistic benefits while providing fewer commodities to the partner species, is commonly believed to erode a mutualistic interaction, leading to its dissolution or reciprocal extinction. However, recent empirical findings indicate that stable associations of mutualists and cheaters have existed over long evolutionary periods. Here, we show that asymmetrical competition within species for the commodities offered by mutualistic partners provides a simple and testable ecological mechanism that can account for the long-term persistence of mutualisms. Cheating, in effect, establishes a background against which better mutualists can display any competitive superiority. This can lead to the coexistence and divergence of mutualist and cheater phenotypes, as well as to the coexistence of ecologically similar, but unrelated mutualists and cheaters.},

	abstract = {Key Words gene transfer, virulence, genome structure, plasmid, bacteriophage s Abstract Virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria (adhesins, toxins, invasins, protein secretion systems, iron uptake systems, and others) may be encoded by partic-ular regions of the prokaryotic genome termed pathogenicity islands. Pathogenicity islands were first described in human pathogens of the species Escherichia coli, but have recently been found in the genomes of various pathogens of humans, animals, and plants. Pathogenicity islands comprise large genomic regions [10--200 kilobases (kb) in size] that are present on the genomes of pathogenic strains but absent from the genomes of nonpathogenic members of the same or related species. The finding that the G+C content of pathogenicity islands often differs from that of the rest of the genome, the presence of direct repeats at their ends, the association of pathogenicity islands with transfer RNA genes, the presence of integrase determinants and other mo-bility loci, and their genetic instability argue for the generation of pathogenicity islands by horizontal gene transfer, a process that is well known to contribute to microbial evo-lution. In this article we review these and other aspects of pathogenicity islands and discuss the concept that they represent a subclass of genomic islands. Genomic islands are present in the majority of genomes of pathogenic as well as nonpathogenic bac-teria and may encode accessory functions which have been previously spread among bacterial populations.},

In addition, quantitative resistance was minimal in offspring of highly infected mothers, and in offspring issued from eggs produced during the early infection phase.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium falciparum infection in An. coluzzii can have trans-generational costs, lowering quantitative resistance in offspring of infected mothers.

	abstract = {Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria that commonly spread through host populations by causing cytoplasmic incompatibility, often expressed as reduced egg hatch when uninfected females mate with infected males. Infected females are frequently less fecund as a consequence of Wolbachia infection. However, theory predicts that because of maternal transmission, these "parasites" will tend to evolve towards a more mutualistic association with their hosts. Drosophila simulans in California provided the classic case of a Wolbachia infection spreading in nature. Cytoplasmic incompatibility allowed the infection to spread through individual populations within a few years and from southern to northern California (more than 700 km) within a decade, despite reducing the fecundity of infected females by 15{\%}-20{\%} under laboratory conditions. Here we show that the Wolbachia in California D. simulans have changed over the last 20 y so that infected females now exhibit an average 10{\%} fecundity advantage over uninfected females in the laboratory. Our data suggest smaller but qualitatively similar changes in relative fecundity in nature and demonstrate that fecundity-increasing Wolbachia variants are currently polymorphic in natural populations.},

It has been often thought that partner choice can stabilize multi-player mutualisms. However, in one-to-many mutualisms partner choice is inevitably asymmetric between hosts and symbionts, which might destabilize the system. Here I develop a simple mathematical model for an obligate one-to-many mutualism, with explicitly considering imperfect ability of symbiont choice by hosts. I fix the trait of hosts and concentrate on the evolutionary dynamics of cooperativeness in symbiont population. Each host chooses a constant number of symbionts from a potential symbiont population, a fraction of which are chosen through preferential choice depending on cooperativeness of the symbionts, while the rest are through random choice. After the association between the host and the symbionts is established, the host offers a constant amount of resource to each associating symbiont. It spends a part of the resource to increase the fitness of the host in proportion to its cooperativeness, and the rest for its own reproduction. I show that pure mutualist population is evolutionarily stable when the fraction of preferential choice c is large and the strength of preferential choice k is small, otherwise mutualists and cheaters coexist. In addition, in the coexistence state the frequency of mutualists increases with c. In contrast, it decreases with k, while the cooperativeness of mutualists increases. The two factors offset against each other, so that the fitness gain of host remains constant.},

@article{Donnelly2017,
	abstract = {Hosts are typically challenged by multiple parasites, but to date theory on the evolution of resistance has mainly focused on single infections. We develop a series of models that examine the impact of multiple parasites on the evolution of resistance under the assumption that parasites coexist at the host population scale as a consequence of superinfection. In this way, we are able to explicitly examine the impact of ecological dynamics on the evolutionary outcome. We use our models to address a key question of how host lifespan affects investment in resistance to multiple parasites. We show that investment in costly resistance depends on the specificity of the immune response and on whether or not the focal parasite leads to more acute infection than the co-circulating parasite. A key finding is that investment in resistance always increases as the immune response becomes more general independently of whether it is the focal or the co-circulating parasite that exploits the host most aggressively. Long-lived hosts always invest more than short-lived hosts in both general resistance and resistance that is specific to relatively acute focal parasites. However, for specific resistance to parasites that are less acute than co-circulating parasites it is the short-lived hosts that are predicted to invest most. We show that these results apply whatever the mode of defence, that is whether it is through avoidance or through increased recovery, with or without acquired immunity, or through acquired immunity itself. As a whole, our results emphasize the importance of considering multiple parasites in determining optimal immune investment in eco-evolutionary systems.},

	abstract = {With few exceptions, parasitic manipulation dramatically reduces host fitness. That said, evidence of host resistance to behavior-manipulating parasites is scarce. Here, we suggest that the evolution of partial resistance, as well as bypass, to manipulation (PRM and BPM, respectively) represents new, seldom-explored options for parasitized hosts. Natural selection could favor hosts that partially resist certain manipulative dimensions to postpone their death and perform additional reproductive episodes (PRM). Alternatively, manipulated hosts may express novel traits that do not alter the manipulation per se but that alleviate its detrimental fitness consequences (BPM). If effective, PRM and BPM have many implications for the ecology and evolution of hosts and their parasites, especially the evolution of multidimensional manipulations.},

@article{Normand2007,
	abstract = {Soil bacteria that also form mutualistic symbioses in plants encounter two major levels of selection. One occurs during adaptation to and survival in soil, and the other occurs in concert with host plant speciation and adaptation. Actinobacteria from the genus Frankia are facultative symbionts that form N(2)-fixing root nodules on diverse and globally distributed angiosperms in the "actinorhizal" symbioses. Three closely related clades of Frankia sp. strains are recognized; members of each clade infect a subset of plants from among eight angiosperm families. We sequenced the genomes from three strains; their sizes varied from 5.43 Mbp for a narrow host range strain (Frankia sp. strain HFPCcI3) to 7.50 Mbp for a medium host range strain (Frankia alni strain ACN14a) to 9.04 Mbp for a broad host range strain (Frankia sp. strain EAN1pec.) This size divergence is the largest yet reported for such closely related soil bacteria (97.8{\%}-98.9{\%} identity of 16S rRNA genes). The extent of gene deletion, duplication, and acquisition is in concert with the biogeographic history of the symbioses and host plant speciation. Host plant isolation favored genome contraction, whereas host plant diversification favored genome expansion. The results support the idea that major genome expansions as well as reductions can occur in facultative symbiotic soil bacteria as they respond to new environments in the context of their symbioses.},

A total of 2580 samples was taken, with 184 (7.1{\%}) yielding isolates. The highest yield for C. difficile was obtained from river waters, with 14 (87.5{\%}) of 16 samples from four rivers positive, and from sea water samples with 7 (44{\%}) of 15 positive from six beaches on the Bristol Channel. In addition, 7 (46.7{\%}) of 15 samples of lake water were also positive. Twenty-two (21{\%}) of 104 soil samples, taken from random sites in Cardiff, were positive, as were 20{\%} of environmental samples from four Cardiff hospitals. C. difficile was also isolated from 50{\%} of eight swimming pool waters examined and 1 (5.5{\%}) of 18 of mains tap water. Carriage of C. difficile in 524 faecal samples of assorted farm animals was c. 1{\%}, and was 10{\%} in dogs and 2{\%} in cats. In private residences, the organism was present in 12 (2.2{\%}) of 550 samples. While 2.4{\%} of 300 raw vegetable samples were positive, none of 107 assorted fish gut contents was. These findings indicate that C. difficile may be more widely distributed in the general environment, particularly water, than was previously thought.},

@article{Holt2017,
	abstract = {Most species have one or more natural enemies, e.g., predators, parasites, pathogens, and herbivores, among others. These species in turn typically attack multiple victim species. This leads to the possibility of indirect inter-actions among those victims, both positive and negative. The term apparent competition commonly denotes negative indirect interactions between vic-tim species that arise because they share a natural enemy. This indirect inter-action, which in principle can be reflected in many facets of the distribution and abundance of individual species and more broadly govern the structure of ecological communities in time and space, pervades many natural ecosys-tems. It also is a central theme in many applied ecological problems, including the control of agricultural pests, harvesting, the conservation of endangered species, and the dynamics of emerging diseases. At one end of the scale of life, apparent competition characterizes intriguing aspects of dynamics within in-dividual organisms---for example, the immune system is akin in many ways to a predator that can induce negative indirect interactions among different pathogens. At intermediate scales of biological organization, the existence and strength of apparent competition depend upon many contingent details of individual behavior and life history, as well as the community and spatial context within which indirect interactions play out. At the broadest scale of macroecology and macroevolution, apparent competition may play a major, if poorly understood, role in the evolution of species' geographical ranges and adaptive radiations.},

	abstract = {Bacillus is commonly isolated from soils, with organisms of Bacillus cereus sensu lato being prevalent. Knowledge of the ecology of B. cereus and other Bacillus species in soil is far from complete. While the older literature favors a model of growth on soil-associated organic matter, the current paradigm is that B. cereus sensu lato germinates and grows in association with animals or plants, resulting in either symbiotic or pathogenic interactions. An in terra approach to study soil-associated bacteria is described, using filter-sterilized soil-extracted soluble organic matter (SESOM) and artificial soil microcosms (ASM) saturated with SESOM. B. cereus ATCC 14579 displayed a life cycle, with the ability to germinate, grow, and subsequently sporulate in both the liquid SESOM extract and in ASM inserted into wells in agar medium. Cells grew in liquid SESOM without separating, forming multicellular structures that coalesced to form clumps and encasing the ensuing spores in an extracellular matrix. Bacillus was able to translocate from the point of inoculation through soil microcosms as shown by the emergence of outgrowths on the surrounding agar surface. Microscopic inspection revealed bundles of parallel chains inside the soil. The motility inhibitor L-ethionine failed to suppress outgrowth, ruling out translocation by a flagellar-mediated mechanism such as swimming or swarming. Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis Marburg and four Bacillus isolates taken at random from soils also displayed a life cycle in SESOM and ASM and were all able to translocate through ASM, even in presence of L-ethionine. These data indicate that B. cereus is a saprophytic bacterium that is able to grow in soil and furthermore that it is adapted to translocate by employing a multicellular mode of growth.},

@article{Crowley2016,
	abstract = {Building on previous work, we derive an optimization model for a two-state stochastic environment and evaluate the fitnesses of five reproductive strategies across generations. To do this, we characterize spatiotemporal variation and define grain (=patch) size as the scale of fitness autocorrelation. Fitness functions of environmental condition are Gaussian. The strategies include two specialists on each of the environmental conditions; two generalists that each fare equally well under both conditions, but one (a conservative bet hedger) optimizes the shape of the fitness function; and a diversified bet hedger producing an optimal mix of the two specialists within individual broods. When the environment is primarily in one of the two states, the specialist on that state achieves the highest fitness. In the more interesting situation where the two environments are equally prevalent in the long term, with low-moderate environmental variation, a generalist strategy (that copes with both states well) does best. Higher variation favors diversified bet hedgers, or surprisingly, specialists, depending mainly on whether spatial or temporal variation predominates. These strategies reduce variance in fitness and optimize the distribution of offspring among patches differently: specialists by spreading offspring among many independently varying patches, while diversified bet hedgers put all offspring into a few patches or a single patch. We distinguish features consistent with strategies like diversified bet hedgers that spread risk in time from features linked to strategies like specialists that spread risk in space. Finally, we present testable hypotheses arising from this study and suggest directions for future work.},

Compelling evidence for two aspects of the SET is now available suggesting that both mitochondria and plastids originated by symbioses with a third type of microbe, probably a Thermoplasma-like archaebacterium ancestral to the nucleocytoplasm. We conclude that not enough information is available to negate or substantiate another SET hypothesis: that the undulipodia (cilia, eukaryotic flagella) evolved from spirochetes. Recognizing the power of symbiosis to recombine in single individual semes from widely differing partners, we develop the idea that symbiosis has been important in the origin of species and higher taxa. The abrupt origin of novel life forms through the formation of stable symbioses is consistent with certain patterns of evolution (e.g punctuated equilibria) described by some paleontologists.},

Mutualism evolves most readily between members of different kingdoms, which pool complementary abilities for mutual benefit: some of these mutualisms represent major evolutionary innovations. Mutualism cannot persist if cheating annihilates its benefits. In long-term mutualisms, symbioses, at least one party associates with the other nearly all its life. Usually, a larger host harbours smaller symbionts. Cheating is restrained by vertical transmission, as in Buchnera; partner fidelity, as among bull-thorn acacias and protective ants; test-based choice of symbionts, as bobtail squid choose bioluminescent bacteria; or sanctioning nonperforming symbionts, as legumes punish nonperforming nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Mutualisms involving brief exchanges, as among plants and seed-dispersers, however, persist despite abundant cheating. Both symbioses and brief-exchange mutualisms have transformed whole ecosystems. These mutualisms may be steps towards ecosystems which, like Adam Smith's ideal economy, serve their members' common good.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary invasion analysis is a powerful technique for modelling in evolutionary biology. The general approach is to derive an expression for the growth rate of a mutant allele encoding some novel phenotype, and then to use this expression to predict long-term evolutionary outcomes. Mathematically, such 'invasion fitness' expressions are most often derived using standard linear stability analyses from dynamical systems theory. Interestingly, there is a mathematically equivalent approach to such stability analyses that is often employed in mathematical epidemiology, and that is based on so-called 'next-generation' matrices. Although this next-generation matrix approach has sometimes also been used in evolutionary invasion analyses, it is not yet common in this area despite the fact that it can sometimes greatly simplify calculations. The aim of this article is to bring the approach to a wider evolutionary audience in two ways. First, we review the next-generation matrix approach and provide a novel, and easily intuited, interpretation of how this approach relates to more standard techniques. Second, we illustrate next-generation methods in evolutionary invasion analysis through a series of informative examples. Although focusing primarily on evolutionary invasion analysis, we provide several insights that apply to biological modelling in general.},

Here, we review the available knowledge on host preference, as this is expected to affect the life history and transmission of infectious pathogens. Host preference is affected by myriad extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Inherent factors are determined by genetic selection, which appears to be controlled by adaptive advantages that result from feeding on certain host species. Host preference of mosquitoes, although having a genetic basis, is characterized by high plasticity mediated by the density of host species, which by their abundance form a readily accessible source of blood. Host-selection behavior in mosquitoes is an exception rather than the rule. Those species that express strong and inherent host-selection behavior belong to the most important vectors of infectious diseases, which suggests that this behavioral trait may have evolved in parallel with parasite-host evolution.},
